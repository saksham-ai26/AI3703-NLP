"self discipline. how to quit addictions, diet, etc. by edburyr jan, medium","how to quit addictions, diet, etc. self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. all of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. if youve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. mindset is crucial in all cases. step : accepting that there is a problem. step : identify reasons for change.change is much easier if backed by good reasons. obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. if your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. this is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. however, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. step :ask yourself why you dont behave as youd like. understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. for example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. experiment until you find an approach that works for you. determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you dont behave as youd like. many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. where this is the case, youll often need to improve your mindset. one of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. witnessing others success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. also, finding out what they did can help. the most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. it can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. step : rules.establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. for example, lets assume youre tackling overspending. youve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. however, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isnt yet on your list and immediately buy it. a new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you cant buy anything youve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. if you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. they may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. if you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. this may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. you could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. when all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. we recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. during reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like google calendar). eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. step : understand the issue you are addressing. most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. were not suggesting that you shouldnt educate yourself about dieting; its just that the mental side matters more. some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. for such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. one way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. if youve experienced issues before, for instance, its unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. the best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. suppose your body language communicates boredom. it is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. a better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. in anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. further tips concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. for further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading kelly mcgonigals excellent book,the willpower instinct. robyn youkilissthin from withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. thanks for reading. my book,optimizing life, can be read for freehere i also offer personal online improvement-related coaching for per hour. please email me atedburyrgmail.comto book or inquire about groups or in-person rates. please also contact me if you would like a print copy of my book. -- -- help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the los angeles fires: the indictment of the fossil fuel industry by ken mcmullen jan, medium","on january , by photomotoman in political editorial share this! i am a retired fire chief, and former educator. for the last years of my year career in the fire service, i attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. it started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. that was years ago. it became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. and throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, ceos, caos, cfos, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. all ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. for me, my experience first began in earnest in , when fires ravaged northern manitoba, my province. i was contracted to the provincial government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. in my time off from being a full-time firefighter, i trained as sartec, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which i acquired privately by training outside the country. i also travelled throughout the north under contract. that year, fires forced the evacuation of , people across communities. however in , i resigned from my fire department in order to take a fire chiefs position in another province. i had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in british columbia where i had been, technically hired. that year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was million dollars. by the end of the summer, the province of british columbia had spent million dollars fighting those fires. in the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as i had already resigned my position, i took a position as the fire chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in ontario, canada in the region of niagara. after eight years, i found myself successfully hired as the fire chief for a jurisdiction in alberta, canada, that surrounded calgary, alberta. within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the rocky mountains and kananaskis provincial park. the fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. my attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. it is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over , wells drilled in . i often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? i will never know, but based on what is occurring in canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. they divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. as my contract ended, and i began a job consulting, in may , a forest fire surrounding slave lake, alberta, home to people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. the loss amounted to million dollars. five years later, in may , fort mcmurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of , structures. the loss amounted to . billion dollars, just in insured losses. a study from macewan university estimated total losses were in the range of billion dollars. in , canadas most destructive year to date, there were more than , fires, and mega fires, that burned million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in canada. experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. and then this year, jasper, alberta, one of the jewels of canadas national parks saw a fire burn , structures. none of these occurrences is normal. none of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. they are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. in , in lytton, bc, another canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. the temperatures for the last three years having exceeded c. at some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in canada in of . c or f. this is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. what does all this have to do with los angeles? this week audie cornish of cnn did a podcast. her guest was peter kalmus, a climate scientist for nasa. his former home, which was destroyed in the los angeles community of altadena, was one of the more than , homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, as a climate scientist, i knew it was time to leave los angeles, on january th, in the new york times. his personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire years he had lived in altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to durham, north carolina. he did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in southern california and nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. and this last week, he was proved right. what is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. yet, americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on fox and to the incoming president of the united states, a man who hasnt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. the problem according to kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. less than half of america elected the current president of the united states (.), yet this mandate enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. they are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. so, where is safe? one of kalmus beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, years ago, is daunting. much of what is to come, is baked into our future. of that, there is certainty. and whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. meanwhile, the question remains. where is safe? kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. climate change is global. obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the united states and canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. but ashland, north carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. so was lytton, british columbia. we are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. it will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. and because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. and none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- my name is ken mcmullen. im a retired director of emergency services and former academic. now retired, im an avid motorcyclist, photographer and blogger. help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"
"midlife meltdowns: three things that can break a woman by nelly scott jan, medium","life is really tough for women, especially those in middle age. eileen chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. when they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but theres no one they can depend on. actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. but thats not how it is for women. they carry so much more on their shoulders. they can pick up the weight, but they cant put it down. its not just about money. its also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work. when all of these things come crashing down at once, a woman will still stand strong, even though she feels totally helpless. middle-aged women may seem tough, but they still have weaknesses. and often, a midlife meltdown starts with these three things. -- -- help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the heart that matters. by terri rimmer by terri persico rimmer jan, medium","the heart that matters by terri rimmer shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment melodys neighbor samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. fantastic! she thought. the establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. you can just give them , and theyll accept that, if you have it, samantha, who used a wheelchair, told melody. in a few days they went to lunch there with samanthas granddaughter and melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. she would be back definitely. over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay or not. she found out though that they did not want her five dollars. they wanted more and made that clear. two years prior, melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldnt afford to get another vehicle. because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. she was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. a friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment melody couldnt do the work. now shed been out of a job for four years, the longest shed ever been unemployed. melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldnt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. the other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but melodys injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. the third time melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. she found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didnt mind, except for this groups attitude of entitlement. melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. she was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. but a professional writerformer pet and house sitter also with years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. and some would ask her for money which she found laughable. the owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didnt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. he gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. this was not the person she was. now it was christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough shed had over a year that shed been on over medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. the allergist had given her the answer shed been seeking since last year regarding her condition it wasnt contagious, it wasnt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. whew! she was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed melody. the manager took her name, and she didnt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. she couldnt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. no sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. hi, friend, he said insincerely. you seem like you dont feel well. melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didnt believe her. well, if you cant get that coughing under control you cant eat today, he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. she thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. the woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. the manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. so, once he walked away melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldnt see it. i know how it is, melody told the woman. i was in a group home before. so, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. now melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. as she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. honestly, it doesnt get any better than the mission here!

"self discipline. how to quit addictions, diet, etc. by edburyr jan, medium","how to quit addictions, diet, etc. self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. all of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. if youve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. mindset is crucial in all cases. step : accepting that there is a problem. step : identify reasons for change.change is much easier if backed by good reasons. obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. if your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. this is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. however, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. step :ask yourself why you dont behave as youd like. understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. for example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. experiment until you find an approach that works for you. determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you dont behave as youd like. many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. where this is the case, youll often need to improve your mindset. one of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. witnessing others success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. also, finding out what they did can help. the most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. it can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. step : rules.establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. for example, lets assume youre tackling overspending. youve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. however, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isnt yet on your list and immediately buy it. a new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you cant buy anything youve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. if you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. they may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. if you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. this may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. you could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. when all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. we recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. during reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like google calendar). eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. step : understand the issue you are addressing. most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. were not suggesting that you shouldnt educate yourself about dieting; its just that the mental side matters more. some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. for such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. one way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. if youve experienced issues before, for instance, its unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. the best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. suppose your body language communicates boredom. it is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. a better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. in anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. further tips concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. for further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading kelly mcgonigals excellent book,the willpower instinct. robyn youkilissthin from withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. thanks for reading. my book,optimizing life, can be read for freehere i also offer personal online improvement-related coaching for per hour. please email me atedburyrgmail.comto book or inquire about groups or in-person rates. please also contact me if you would like a print copy of my book. -- -- help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the los angeles fires: the indictment of the fossil fuel industry by ken mcmullen jan, medium","on january , by photomotoman in political editorial share this! i am a retired fire chief, and former educator. for the last years of my year career in the fire service, i attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. it started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. that was years ago. it became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. and throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, ceos, caos, cfos, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. all ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. for me, my experience first began in earnest in , when fires ravaged northern manitoba, my province. i was contracted to the provincial government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. in my time off from being a full-time firefighter, i trained as sartec, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which i acquired privately by training outside the country. i also travelled throughout the north under contract. that year, fires forced the evacuation of , people across communities. however in , i resigned from my fire department in order to take a fire chiefs position in another province. i had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in british columbia where i had been, technically hired. that year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was million dollars. by the end of the summer, the province of british columbia had spent million dollars fighting those fires. in the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as i had already resigned my position, i took a position as the fire chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in ontario, canada in the region of niagara. after eight years, i found myself successfully hired as the fire chief for a jurisdiction in alberta, canada, that surrounded calgary, alberta. within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the rocky mountains and kananaskis provincial park. the fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. my attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. it is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over , wells drilled in . i often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? i will never know, but based on what is occurring in canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. they divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. as my contract ended, and i began a job consulting, in may , a forest fire surrounding slave lake, alberta, home to people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. the loss amounted to million dollars. five years later, in may , fort mcmurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of , structures. the loss amounted to . billion dollars, just in insured losses. a study from macewan university estimated total losses were in the range of billion dollars. in , canadas most destructive year to date, there were more than , fires, and mega fires, that burned million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in canada. experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. and then this year, jasper, alberta, one of the jewels of canadas national parks saw a fire burn , structures. none of these occurrences is normal. none of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. they are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. in , in lytton, bc, another canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. the temperatures for the last three years having exceeded c. at some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in canada in of . c or f. this is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. what does all this have to do with los angeles? this week audie cornish of cnn did a podcast. her guest was peter kalmus, a climate scientist for nasa. his former home, which was destroyed in the los angeles community of altadena, was one of the more than , homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, as a climate scientist, i knew it was time to leave los angeles, on january th, in the new york times. his personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire years he had lived in altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to durham, north carolina. he did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in southern california and nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. and this last week, he was proved right. what is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. yet, americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on fox and to the incoming president of the united states, a man who hasnt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. the problem according to kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. less than half of america elected the current president of the united states (.), yet this mandate enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. they are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. so, where is safe? one of kalmus beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, years ago, is daunting. much of what is to come, is baked into our future. of that, there is certainty. and whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. meanwhile, the question remains. where is safe? kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. climate change is global. obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the united states and canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. but ashland, north carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. so was lytton, british columbia. we are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. it will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. and because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. and none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- my name is ken mcmullen. im a retired director of emergency services and former academic. now retired, im an avid motorcyclist, photographer and blogger. help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

she thought. the establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. you can just give them , and theyll accept that, if you have it, samantha, who used a wheelchair, told melody. in a few days they went to lunch there with samanthas granddaughter and melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. she would be back definitely. over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay or not. she found out though that they did not want her five dollars. they wanted more and made that clear. two years prior, melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldnt afford to get another vehicle. because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. she was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. a friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment melody couldnt do the work. now shed been out of a job for four years, the longest shed ever been unemployed. melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldnt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. the other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but melodys injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. the third time melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. she found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didnt mind, except for this groups attitude of entitlement. melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. she was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. but a professional writerformer pet and house sitter also with years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. and some would ask her for money which she found laughable. the owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didnt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. he gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. this was not the person she was. now it was christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough shed had over a year that shed been on over medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. the allergist had given her the answer shed been seeking since last year regarding her condition it wasnt contagious, it wasnt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. whew! she was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed melody. the manager took her name, and she didnt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. she couldnt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. no sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. hi, friend, he said insincerely. you seem like you dont feel well. melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didnt believe her. well, if you cant get that coughing under control you cant eat today, he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. she thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. the woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. the manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. so, once he walked away melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldnt see it. i know how it is, melody told the woman. i was in a group home before. so, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. now melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. as she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. honestly, it doesnt get any better than the mission here!

"why perfectionism is a hindrance? by maryam jan, medium","are you also a perfectionist like me? i always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. under too much pressure to be perfect, i was always an average student because instead of working hard, i kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. this all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. i knew i had to make a change. it wasnt an easy process, but i actively decided to find the solution. so, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that i can decide when to stop chasing for it. learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. in this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve hisher full potential. its the obsession that creates the problem. we just have to know the limits! do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know its probably unattainable? why do we do this? lets unpack that a bit. essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. it encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. from an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently perfect lives' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. the flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. this constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. nobody likes failing, right? sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. we always think like, if i aim high enough, ill minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing. this fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. the problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. excess of anything is harmful. our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. we are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. these images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. the pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. by meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. they may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. the ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. but sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. for some of us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. we believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. its a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though its often based on flawed assumptions. many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; its about earning approval and acceptance. -brene brown the pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. when were so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. we might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. as alexander pope aptly said, to err is human, to forgive divine embrace imperfection and recognize that its a natural part of the human experience. it also helps to reframe our definition of success. instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. did we learn something new? did we overcome a challenge? those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasnt ""perfect."" ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. by embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives. do comment if you liked the article and share your views on chasing perfection and excellence. thank you -- -- an aspiring writer help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the silent enemy: why cancer is smarter than you think by saad elbekri, md jan, medium","imagine you're sitting in a doctor's office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: ""you have cancer."" it's shocking. every day, , people face this same unexpected reality. most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: ""i felt perfectly healthy."" they didn't realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. i have some terrible news: you have a in chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. but wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. but here's the catch: it's far more complicated than it seems. even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting i've performed. and despite all our training and research doctors still don't fully understand cancer. cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body's defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine's biggest challenges. at its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. the real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don't follow the rules. usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body's police force your immune system and removed. even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body's defences. this buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. as the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. when the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. my colleagues and i can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. still, that's precisely for situations i'm getting paid for, and i like it. but here's where it gets tricky: cancer cells have a unique ability they can take highways through your body to spread. this process is calledmetastasis. there are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: at this point, treatment becomes more complicated. surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. metastasis no longer means the end it just means the treatment needs more personalization. but the big question remains. damage occurs when the cell's dna is altered. cell dna acts as the user manual for how your cell works. when that manual is damaged, the cell develops dna mutations, which cause it to malfunction. there are two ways a cell can get damaged: purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. it's like receiving an altered manual the moment you're born. cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of dna damage. sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. cancers show up much later. bad habits usually cause this type of dna mutation. for example (to name a few): those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell's dna, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. but cancer cells are smarter than you think. the more damage a cell accumulates, the more its dna gets altered. cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. it can now: it's like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. and here is how they do it. cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body's defences: yes. thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. but there's an even better approach: the best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. your health is worth it. take the first step today

"why soft skills matter as much as tech in digital health leadership by dr. ehoneah obed jan, medium","digital health startups are obsessed with technology, but what if the real competitive edge lies in skills that cant be coded? in an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ai-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices its easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasnt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. after all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary ai model is what attracts funding and headlines. but heres the catch: digital health is not just about technology; its about people. whether its convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. in fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the people side of the business. to be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. a leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. however, technology alone cant explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. its the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? or one who can design a wearable but cant address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? in digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but its time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code. communication, empathy, and relationship-building are not optional theyre essential. as we shape the future of healthcare, the question is: are we building leaders who can connect as well as they can innovate? -- -- digital health solutions architect pharmacist software engineer aws certified solutions architect associate content creator help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"healing humanity or modern eugenics? crispr determines the future of human evolution by shaelin gorny jan, medium","imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. a world where individuals dont spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like huntingtons disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. a world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. this is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. but alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. a dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where crispr places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. while genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. in ,chinese scientist he jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to hiv, resulting in the birth of twin girls(raposo). globally,. million people have died from hiv, yet with crispr, no more have to (hiv). while this trial showcased gene editings revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.the experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(what are the ethical concerns?). a clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. but what happens when scientific experimentation isnt strictly monitored? in the cases of thetuskegee syphilis study,henrietta lacks,nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: catastrophe. this same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. what happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.a study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(agha et al.). narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. however, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. this technology could end generations of suffering.genome mutations cause roughly , known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (using gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases). crispr technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as huntingtons disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. this technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable current treatment costs of . million reflect the high expense of novel technologies it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (pagliarulo and lucas). unfortunately, humans wont stop at disease eradication. if we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldnt we? enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. take theccr- mutation, which chinese scientist he jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(sanders). this mutation prohibits hiv infection, yetincreases susceptibility to west nile virus and leads to a higher overall mortality rate(sanders). this is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(accelerating global access to gene therapies). while disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. what may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. such pursuits are simply indefensible. what is the true cost of progress? when ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? well, lets review a familiar example. what did he jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? prison. reckless application of crispr technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. but on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? if genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. the stakes couldnt be higher.the world health organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(health ethics governance). without enforcement, these measures are futile. crispr holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. but if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. this isnt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. as a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing?

"the silent epidemic. understanding cardiodiabesity's threat by luis cisneros jan, medium","in discussions about americas most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. this complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. its a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. research by evernorth reveals a startling statistic: of adults in the united states suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. this figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. the rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. between and , adult obesity rates soared from . to .. if current trends persist, half of all american adults could be classified as obese by . but this is far from a superficial issue it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. the financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of billion annually. to put this into perspective, consider sarah, a -year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. over time, she developed type diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. sarahs story mirrors that of millions of americans. collectively, the costs associated with obesity ( billion), heart disease and stroke ( billion), and diabetes ( billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. these expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. while individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. social and economic factors account for of health outcomes, according to public health data. these include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability all of which shape an individuals ability to maintain good health. the physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for and , respectively. this breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. it is better to prevent than to cure. ibn sina the encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable and, in many cases, reversible. early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. a variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. take, for instance, the initiative led by cigna healthcare in partnership with virgin pulse. by allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. the impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. addressing cardiodiabesity isnt just a moral imperative its an economic one. companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. on a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. the stakes are enormous. cardiodiabesity isnt just a set of disconnected health problems its a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of american

"self discipline. how to quit addictions, diet, etc. by edburyr jan, medium","how to quit addictions, diet, etc. self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. all of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. if youve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. mindset is crucial in all cases. step : accepting that there is a problem. step : identify reasons for change.change is much easier if backed by good reasons. obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. if your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. this is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. however, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. step :ask yourself why you dont behave as youd like. understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. for example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. experiment until you find an approach that works for you. determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you dont behave as youd like. many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. where this is the case, youll often need to improve your mindset. one of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. witnessing others success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. also, finding out what they did can help. the most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. it can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. step : rules.establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. for example, lets assume youre tackling overspending. youve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. however, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isnt yet on your list and immediately buy it. a new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you cant buy anything youve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. if you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. they may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. if you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. this may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. you could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. when all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. we recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. during reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like google calendar). eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. step : understand the issue you are addressing. most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. were not suggesting that you shouldnt educate yourself about dieting; its just that the mental side matters more. some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. for such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. one way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. if youve experienced issues before, for instance, its unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. the best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. suppose your body language communicates boredom. it is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. a better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. in anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. further tips concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. for further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading kelly mcgonigals excellent book,the willpower instinct. robyn youkilissthin from withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. thanks for reading. my book,optimizing life, can be read for freehere i also offer personal online improvement-related coaching for per hour. please email me atedburyrgmail.comto book or inquire about groups or in-person rates. please also contact me if you would like a print copy of my book. -- -- help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the los angeles fires: the indictment of the fossil fuel industry by ken mcmullen jan, medium","on january , by photomotoman in political editorial share this! i am a retired fire chief, and former educator. for the last years of my year career in the fire service, i attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. it started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. that was years ago. it became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. and throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, ceos, caos, cfos, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. all ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. for me, my experience first began in earnest in , when fires ravaged northern manitoba, my province. i was contracted to the provincial government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. in my time off from being a full-time firefighter, i trained as sartec, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which i acquired privately by training outside the country. i also travelled throughout the north under contract. that year, fires forced the evacuation of , people across communities. however in , i resigned from my fire department in order to take a fire chiefs position in another province. i had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in british columbia where i had been, technically hired. that year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was million dollars. by the end of the summer, the province of british columbia had spent million dollars fighting those fires. in the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as i had already resigned my position, i took a position as the fire chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in ontario, canada in the region of niagara. after eight years, i found myself successfully hired as the fire chief for a jurisdiction in alberta, canada, that surrounded calgary, alberta. within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the rocky mountains and kananaskis provincial park. the fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. my attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. it is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over , wells drilled in . i often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? i will never know, but based on what is occurring in canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. they divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. as my contract ended, and i began a job consulting, in may , a forest fire surrounding slave lake, alberta, home to people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. the loss amounted to million dollars. five years later, in may , fort mcmurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of , structures. the loss amounted to . billion dollars, just in insured losses. a study from macewan university estimated total losses were in the range of billion dollars. in , canadas most destructive year to date, there were more than , fires, and mega fires, that burned million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in canada. experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. and then this year, jasper, alberta, one of the jewels of canadas national parks saw a fire burn , structures. none of these occurrences is normal. none of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. they are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. in , in lytton, bc, another canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. the temperatures for the last three years having exceeded c. at some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in canada in of . c or f. this is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. what does all this have to do with los angeles? this week audie cornish of cnn did a podcast. her guest was peter kalmus, a climate scientist for nasa. his former home, which was destroyed in the los angeles community of altadena, was one of the more than , homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, as a climate scientist, i knew it was time to leave los angeles, on january th, in the new york times. his personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire years he had lived in altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to durham, north carolina. he did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in southern california and nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. and this last week, he was proved right. what is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. yet, americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on fox and to the incoming president of the united states, a man who hasnt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. the problem according to kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. less than half of america elected the current president of the united states (.), yet this mandate enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. they are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. so, where is safe? one of kalmus beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, years ago, is daunting. much of what is to come, is baked into our future. of that, there is certainty. and whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. meanwhile, the question remains. where is safe? kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. climate change is global. obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the united states and canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. but ashland, north carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. so was lytton, british columbia. we are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. it will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. and because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. and none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- my name is ken mcmullen. im a retired director of emergency services and former academic. now retired, im an avid motorcyclist, photographer and blogger. help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"
"midlife meltdowns: three things that can break a woman by nelly scott jan, medium","life is really tough for women, especially those in middle age. eileen chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. when they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but theres no one they can depend on. actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. but thats not how it is for women. they carry so much more on their shoulders. they can pick up the weight, but they cant put it down. its not just about money. its also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work. when all of these things come crashing down at once, a woman will still stand strong, even though she feels totally helpless. middle-aged women may seem tough, but they still have weaknesses. and often, a midlife meltdown starts with these three things. -- -- help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the heart that matters. by terri rimmer by terri persico rimmer jan, medium","the heart that matters by terri rimmer shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment melodys neighbor samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. fantastic! she thought. the establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. you can just give them , and theyll accept that, if you have it, samantha, who used a wheelchair, told melody. in a few days they went to lunch there with samanthas granddaughter and melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. she would be back definitely. over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay or not. she found out though that they did not want her five dollars. they wanted more and made that clear. two years prior, melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldnt afford to get another vehicle. because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. she was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. a friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment melody couldnt do the work. now shed been out of a job for four years, the longest shed ever been unemployed. melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldnt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. the other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but melodys injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. the third time melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. she found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didnt mind, except for this groups attitude of entitlement. melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. she was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. but a professional writerformer pet and house sitter also with years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. and some would ask her for money which she found laughable. the owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didnt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. he gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. this was not the person she was. now it was christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough shed had over a year that shed been on over medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. the allergist had given her the answer shed been seeking since last year regarding her condition it wasnt contagious, it wasnt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. whew! she was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed melody. the manager took her name, and she didnt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. she couldnt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. no sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. hi, friend, he said insincerely. you seem like you dont feel well. melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didnt believe her. well, if you cant get that coughing under control you cant eat today, he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. she thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. the woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. the manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. so, once he walked away melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldnt see it. i know how it is, melody told the woman. i was in a group home before. so, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. now melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. as she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. honestly, it doesnt get any better than the mission here!

"why perfectionism is a hindrance? by maryam jan, medium","are you also a perfectionist like me? i always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. under too much pressure to be perfect, i was always an average student because instead of working hard, i kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. this all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. i knew i had to make a change. it wasnt an easy process, but i actively decided to find the solution. so, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that i can decide when to stop chasing for it. learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. in this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve hisher full potential. its the obsession that creates the problem. we just have to know the limits! do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know its probably unattainable? why do we do this? lets unpack that a bit. essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. it encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. from an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently perfect lives' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. the flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. this constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. nobody likes failing, right? sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. we always think like, if i aim high enough, ill minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing. this fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. the problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. excess of anything is harmful. our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. we are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. these images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. the pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. by meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. they may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. the ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. but sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. for some of us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. we believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. its a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though its often based on flawed assumptions. many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; its about earning approval and acceptance. -brene brown the pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. when were so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. we might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. as alexander pope aptly said, to err is human, to forgive divine embrace imperfection and recognize that its a natural part of the human experience. it also helps to reframe our definition of success. instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. did we learn something new? did we overcome a challenge? those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasnt ""perfect."" ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. by embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives. do comment if you liked the article and share your views on chasing perfection and excellence. thank you -- -- an aspiring writer help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the silent enemy: why cancer is smarter than you think by saad elbekri, md jan, medium","imagine you're sitting in a doctor's office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: ""you have cancer."" it's shocking. every day, , people face this same unexpected reality. most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: ""i felt perfectly healthy."" they didn't realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. i have some terrible news: you have a in chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. but wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. but here's the catch: it's far more complicated than it seems. even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting i've performed. and despite all our training and research doctors still don't fully understand cancer. cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body's defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine's biggest challenges. at its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. the real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don't follow the rules. usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body's police force your immune system and removed. even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body's defences. this buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. as the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. when the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. my colleagues and i can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. still, that's precisely for situations i'm getting paid for, and i like it. but here's where it gets tricky: cancer cells have a unique ability they can take highways through your body to spread. this process is calledmetastasis. there are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: at this point, treatment becomes more complicated. surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. metastasis no longer means the end it just means the treatment needs more personalization. but the big question remains. damage occurs when the cell's dna is altered. cell dna acts as the user manual for how your cell works. when that manual is damaged, the cell develops dna mutations, which cause it to malfunction. there are two ways a cell can get damaged: purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. it's like receiving an altered manual the moment you're born. cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of dna damage. sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. cancers show up much later. bad habits usually cause this type of dna mutation. for example (to name a few): those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell's dna, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. but cancer cells are smarter than you think. the more damage a cell accumulates, the more its dna gets altered. cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. it can now: it's like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. and here is how they do it. cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body's defences: yes. thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. but there's an even better approach: the best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. your health is worth it. take the first step today

"healing humanity or modern eugenics? crispr determines the future of human evolution by shaelin gorny jan, medium","imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. a world where individuals dont spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like huntingtons disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. a world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. this is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. but alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. a dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where crispr places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. while genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. in ,chinese scientist he jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to hiv, resulting in the birth of twin girls(raposo). globally,. million people have died from hiv, yet with crispr, no more have to (hiv). while this trial showcased gene editings revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.the experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(what are the ethical concerns?). a clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. but what happens when scientific experimentation isnt strictly monitored? in the cases of thetuskegee syphilis study,henrietta lacks,nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: catastrophe. this same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. what happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.a study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(agha et al.). narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. however, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. this technology could end generations of suffering.genome mutations cause roughly , known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (using gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases). crispr technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as huntingtons disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. this technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable current treatment costs of . million reflect the high expense of novel technologies it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (pagliarulo and lucas). unfortunately, humans wont stop at disease eradication. if we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldnt we? enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. take theccr- mutation, which chinese scientist he jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(sanders). this mutation prohibits hiv infection, yetincreases susceptibility to west nile virus and leads to a higher overall mortality rate(sanders). this is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(accelerating global access to gene therapies). while disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. what may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. such pursuits are simply indefensible. what is the true cost of progress? when ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? well, lets review a familiar example. what did he jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? prison. reckless application of crispr technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. but on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? if genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. the stakes couldnt be higher.the world health organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(health ethics governance). without enforcement, these measures are futile. crispr holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. but if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. this isnt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. as a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing?

"the silent epidemic. understanding cardiodiabesity's threat by luis cisneros jan, medium","in discussions about americas most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. this complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. its a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. research by evernorth reveals a startling statistic: of adults in the united states suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. this figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. the rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. between and , adult obesity rates soared from . to .. if current trends persist, half of all american adults could be classified as obese by . but this is far from a superficial issue it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. the financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of billion annually. to put this into perspective, consider sarah, a -year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. over time, she developed type diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. sarahs story mirrors that of millions of americans. collectively, the costs associated with obesity ( billion), heart disease and stroke ( billion), and diabetes ( billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. these expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. while individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. social and economic factors account for of health outcomes, according to public health data. these include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability all of which shape an individuals ability to maintain good health. the physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for and , respectively. this breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. it is better to prevent than to cure. ibn sina the encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable and, in many cases, reversible. early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. a variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. take, for instance, the initiative led by cigna healthcare in partnership with virgin pulse. by allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. the impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. addressing cardiodiabesity isnt just a moral imperative its an economic one. companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. on a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. the stakes are enormous. cardiodiabesity isnt just a set of disconnected health problems its a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of american life, from families to workplaces to entire communities. this is not a challenge we can address piecemeal or delay for another generation. if we fail to act, millions will continue to face shortened lives, mounting medical bills, and preventable suffering. weve seen what coordinated action can do in the face of major health threats like cancer or heart disease. its time to bring that same urgency and focus to cardiodiabesity. the longer we wait, the more lives and resources we lose to a crisis that we already know how to address. this isnt just about statistics its about people, families, and futures that dont have to be cut short. the responsibility to address this crisis can no longer be postponed. -- -- ceo and founder of nudge health visit us atwww.mynudgehealth.com help status about

"why parents should include their children in organized sports by emory menefee jan, medium","why parents should include their children in organized sports its important that parents put their kids in organized sports while growing up as it has many benefits such as maintaining strong health, heightened concentration in school, as well as psychological and social benefits as they progress into adulthood. i can vouch that sports have shaped the person i am today and helped me overcome the obstacles i encountered while growing up. when my parents separated and went through the divorce process, sports were a pivotal outlet for me. it was an area of freedom and fun away from my outside life. as a young adult who has suffered from anxiety and depression since i was thirteen due to the things happening with my family, i can say without a doubt that sports saved me. many of my fondest memories and accomplishments came from being in sports, like scoring the game winning goal with thirty-one seconds left my junior year to be crowned the league champions with my soccer team. i dont get the best moment of my life without organized sports. for starters, physical activity helps maintain strong health. exercising is one of the best ways to keep children in shape and to help prevent diseases and illnesses. (national institutes of health, ). studies showed that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of injuries, different types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer, as well as reducing risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure. the american journal of preventive medicine said after school physical programs have reduced obesity the most. having your kids stay active would help reduce lower medical care as they would be healthier more often which also results in less financial burdens. as mothers and fathers, one of your main goals in life is to always keep your kids safe, and having kids in organized sports keeps your kids healthy which helps towards that goal. kids participating in organized sports growing up have shown to translate into benefits in the learning environment. a study that followed children from kindergarten to fourth grade showed that physical activities help children to develop and improve their cognitive skills. it has been associated with children getting better grades and doing better on standardized tests. physical activity has also been shown to improve attitudes and academic behavior including enhanced concentration and attention (gao, ). sports have always motivated me to have higher concentration in my academics to make sure i maintained solid grades. my parents would not allow me to participate in my sports if my grades werent good. that extra incentive while growing up helped me especially in middle school to stay focused and committed to getting good grades. those good grades alongside sports helped me get admitted into a selective prep high school. studies on the high school age group showed that teenagers who participated in sports are more likely to attend college and get degrees than non-athletes. studies have shown that sports can have beneficial effects on individuals even into their adulthoods, which explained that the benefits extend into the workplace. a survey of female corporate executives found that played a sport growing up and said it beneficially impacted their career success. (ey women athletes business networkespnw, ). additionally, physical activity has also been proven to have a positive impact on mental health and social skills. kids who are involved in physical activity have reported to have more excitement, more happiness and motivation in their day to day lives, whereas kids who are inactive reported greater nervousness, anxiety, depression, and worry. physical activity has been shown to boost self-esteem, leadership, and goal-setting skills. a study found that children who reported to have no physical activity in their life were twice as likely to have mental health issues. according to the united nations, sports have been proven to provide a safe environment and community for many participants. they may be having trouble at school or having issues at home. organized sports have helped kids find an outlet from their everyday lives. it helps unite these kids to learn how to work together in a manner that also teaches them to learn the value of teamwork and respect. additionally, it helps teach children at a young age to develop a passion for something. i fell in love with soccer and basketball when i was three. i developed many of the friendships and relationships i hold dear to this day. the community i fostered at a young age never faltered. i still reach out to old coaches i have had in the past for advice and guidance. i still keep in touch with old teammates and all of us wish each other success and happiness whenever we see one another accomplishing the goals we set when we were younger. i acknowledge that organized sports as the years progress the cost to participate also increases. theres a fee for equipment, travel cost, hotel and food. my parents paid for me to play club soccer from age ten to eighteen. countless practices and games. many tournaments required us to travel to different states. different jerseys, shorts, and socks each and every year. i agree that it can add up. when i spoke to my parents, i had asked them if they regretted any of it and they said no. they were just proud of where their daughter is today. citations: the mental health benefits of exercise.helpguide.org, childrens hospital colorado, oct. ,www.helpguide.orgwellnessfitnessthe-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise. psychological benefits of exercise.psychological benefits of exercise association for applied sport psychology,appliedsportpsych.orgresourceshealth-fitness-resourcespsychological-benefits-of-exercise. accessed jan. . youth sports facts: benefits project play.

"when rest feels like a distant dream by steven clario jan, medium","theres a weight that settles deep within you, one that no amount of sleep seems to lift. you try to rest, to let go, but the moment you close your eyes, the thoughts come rushing in.did i do enough today? did i say the right thing? what about tomorrow?its like trying to swim in quicksand the harder you fight, the deeper you sink. rest isnt just lying down; its surrendering, and for some of us, surrender feels dangerous. the silence of stillness can be deafening, amplifying all the doubts and fears weve spent the day trying to drown out. we tell ourselves well rest later, after weve done more, fixed more, achieved more. but later never comes, and the exhaustion grows, until even the idea of rest feels impossible. somewhere along the way, we learned to equate rest with laziness, with failure.if you stop, youll fall behind.if you rest, youre weak.these lies become our truth, and we wear our exhaustion like a badge of honor, proof that were working hard, trying hard, living hard. but deep down, we know the truth: were breaking. its hard to rest when youve convinced yourself that your worth is tied to how much you do, how much you give, how much you endure. its hard to rest when youre afraid of what might surface in the quiet the fears youve buried, the grief youve ignored, the parts of yourself youve been too scared to face. just like your heart needs a beat of silence between every pulse, you need moments to pause, to breathe, to simply exist without expectation. rest isnt a sign of weakness; its an act of courage. its saying,i choose to care for myself, even when the world tells me i shouldnt. and yes, its terrifying. slowing down feels like losing control. but control is an illusion anyway. the world will keep spinning whether youre running yourself into the ground or taking a moment to recover. the difference is, when you choose rest, you give yourself a chance to heal, to rebuild, to carry on without breaking completely. so, if you feel like you cant stop stop anyway. not forever, not all at once, but for a moment. let the world wait. let the guilt scream and the doubts whisper. sit with them. breathe through them. and remind yourself of this truth:you are not your productivity. your value isnt measured by how much you give to others but by the fact that you are here, alive, trying. even if rest feels impossible now, its not. start small a breath, a pause, a moment of stillness. you deserve to be whole, not just whats left after everyone else has taken their share. you deserve peace, even when the world doesnt offer it freely. and most of all, you deserve rest because youve carried enough for today. -- -- navigating mental health, and something about growth. still learning, still fighting, and finding strength in every step of the journey. help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the cdc and department of health investigated my deadly case of botulism, and no one knows about it. by m. e. karty jan, medium","below is an unanswered, unacknowledged email i sent about my foodborne botulism case to a journalist in indianapolis, indiana . i almost died of food poisoning, was paralyzed and on a ventilator of two months, and it doesnt make the paper? no news outlets? not even a blogpost? are you kidding me? i am just now healthy enough to write about it. i am not going to shut up about it, because food safety will only get worse under this next administration. until i am dead, i will not be silenced. hello ms. xxxxxx, i received your information from xssss xssssssss, a colleague of yours. he thought you would be the person to direct this story. on august th, , my husband and i contracted foodborne botulism. after a night of violent vomiting and other gastrointestinal distress, things turned worse. within hours, i lost the use of my legs and had shortness of breath. my husband was vomiting as well and had double vision and we were both slurring our words. something deathly was wrong. we called my brother-in-law, a hospitalist md out of xxxxxxx, and he said to go to the emergency room immediately. my father-in-law from xxxxxxx happened to be in the area visiting his sister and took my husband to community north. we called an ambulance for me because i couldnt move and was gasping for air. we believe we were diagnosed with botulism in a timely manner because we went in together. by all looks of things, my husband, a fifty-year-old, looked like he was having a stroke. what we conjecture is that his symptoms along with my descending paralysis from the head down was how they caught it. by then, the paralysis had reached my diaphragm and i could no longer breathe on my own. by the grace of god and excellent medical care, a doctor recognized our combined symptoms as botulism. there is a test for botulism, and that takes four days. i think without intervention, i would have been dead within hours. the doctor called the cdc and an anti-toxin was flown in from chicago. the anti-toxin was administered, and we lived. my husband left the hospital, walking with a cane breathing on his own, in three weeks. my exposure must have been more extreme because i was a lot sicker. after two days of struggling to breath, i was intubated after what can only be categorized as a near death experience. i later had a tracheostomy and breathed through a tube in my neck for eight weeks. it took me a full twelve weeks to recover from the paralysis to walk and talk again. it has been five months, and i still have to walk with a walker. that is one heck of a story, right? so why is our case on the cdc or indiana health departments website? i called the indiana health department and they said there has to be at least ten cases in order for it to be worthy of public record. two cases of botulism are two cases too many. i understand because of hippa, that my anonymity is paramount, but so is public health. i am willing to out myself to bring attention to this deadly, but treatable disease. yes, botulism is rare and only deadly in five percent of cases, if it is caught in time. many of my doctors and nurses said they havent seen a botulism case in twenty years. that doesnt mean that there were unreported botulism because it was not diagnosed in time. undiagnosed botulism looks like heart failure or unexplained pnemonia. i was lucky and healthy enough to recover. i was lucky to have insurance and to live in indianapolis with access to top notch health centers like community north and rehabilitation hospital of indiana (rhi). i was lucky to have the forty pounds to lose in two months. i had no underlying conditions. you change one factor, and im dead of suffocation or heart failure in the first twenty-four hours, or im dead of pneumonia in two weeks. i am a miracle of luck and medical science, and no one outside of my inner circle knows about it. i want everyone to know about it. our food supply chain is already shaky because of monopolies, and i fear with the incoming administration and the overturning of the chevron decision that essentially weakened federal agencies, such as the fda, things will get worse. if my ordeal can make a difference, i am willing to forgo my anonymity for healthcare providers, legislators, and the public to know how to protect themselves when dinner turns deadly. i am looking forward to speaking with you. sincerely, m k botulism survivor -- -- help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"
"sit-to-stand desks: a small change for a big impact by margaret fennebresque jan, medium","with around of the child population overweight or obese and unable to read at a basic level, i think we can all agree that good health and academic optimization are two things america needs more of (fiorenzi;literacy statistics ). what if i were to tell you that there is a simple action that american schools can take that addresses both health complications and academic hardships? well, i hope youre on the edge of your seat because i want you to get out of it. thats right stand up, as my research has led me to believe that the solution is standing! american schools should transition to sit-to-stand desks to take advantage of the plethora of benefits to standing instead of sitting, ranging from hindering health issues like diabetes and adhd to cultivating academic success by improving mood and averting hours of unproductivity. tens of thousands of hours of every americans life is spent at school, and of this time is spent sitting down (leech;prepwise).sitting is the new smoking, you might have heard, and this claim is backed by findings linking health complications such as obesity, type- diabetes, and heart disease to sedentary time (fiorenzi). fortunately, standing desks, being on the path to movement, aids in combating each of such complications. standing burns more calories than sitting, averaging an additional calories per hour in adults, and studies have shown that obese or overweight children burn even more than their healthy-weight peers (fiorenzi). standing has been found to reduce blood sugar spikes after meals, a benefit especially helpful for diabetics but good for everyone since greater amplitudes of glycemic variability have been linked to circulatory oxidative stress (jubbal). standing is also connected with better heart health, as a study consisting of sitting and standing bus drivers observed that the standing drivers risk for heart disease was half of that of the sitting drivers (leech). if standing were to become the social norm, both the physiological perks and a new social pressure to be healthy enough to stand for longer periods would hinder health complications in the american school population. consistent with the correlation between better health and academic achievement, sit-to-stand desks provide users with a better learning experience by optimizing key factors to academic success, including productivity, mood, and attention (kurniawan;schmidt;valiente). one of the more obvious perks of a standing desk is postural improvement; good posture naturally reduces back, neck and sciatica pain (leech). according to astudy, patients suffering from chronic pain had an average reduction of . hours of work productivity per week. im not sure about you, but i can learn quite a lot in almost hours. a lesser known perk of a standing desk is its effect on mood: a positive one to be more specific. in one study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue and reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day and after returning to sitting desks their moods reverted to their original levels (leech). this study complements other research finding sitting and sedentary lifestyles linked with increased risks of depression and anxiety (leech). as a student, i can attest that maintaining a positive outlook has pushed me to take risks that have led to my own academic success. although you might have expected that standing desks would create distraction for children, i have found far more evidence suggesting just the opposite. i acknowledge that there is some anecdotal evidence documenting young children bumping into one another while using standing desks, however, recall that chairs create similar distractions including rocking, footsie, and leg swinging (the effects of standing desks). on the other hand, one study demonstrated that students using standing desks exhibited significant improvements in attention and inhibitory control compared to their sitting peers, and schoolchildren in the experiment group of another study that used standing-desks were found to be between and more engaged than the control group (fiorenzi;otto). dr. mark benden of texas am health science center school of public health explains this finding well: when kids sit at a desk all day, they dont have to use any energy, which means they can just as easily fall asleep, daydream, or distract themselves by distracting others (fiorenzi). at least for me, it ismuchharder to fall asleep standing up. considering that standing expends more energy than sitting, its logical that distraction would be reduced, a boon particularly for millions of american children diagnosed with add or adhd (fiorenzi). hopefully at this point, youre convinced that standing desks have immense benefits. you may still be wondering, though, is it worth the effort to replace all sitting desks with standing desks? allow me to clarify what i mean by transitioning to sit-to-stand desks. itd be a waste to toss out perfectly adequate sitting desks already owned, but i do think that when schools are in the market for new desks, they should purchase sit-to-stand desks. sit-to-stand desks allow users to adjust the height of the desk, giving them the option to sit or stand, thereby taking into consideration the needs of physically disabled children and providing flexibility for various activities. lastly, whereas the monetary price of sit-to-stand desks might be slightly more than that of a sitting-only desk, having the ability to make use of the numerous, substantial advantages of standing sure seem to outweigh that small cost differential. if you believe in having a healthy, educated population, i urge you to use your influence as a student, parent, teacher, staff member, administrator, or alumni to advocate for sit-to-stand desks in your school. dutta, sanchari sinha. sitting is the new smoking. news-medical.net, sept. ,www.news-medical.nethealthsitting-is-the-new-smoking.aspx. fiorenzi, ryan. benefits of sitting vs. standing for children. start standing, apr. ,www.startstanding.orgsitting-vs-standing-for-children. garcia, marta. a space for all of us: setting up the classroom environment.investigations, terc, nov. ,investigations.terc.edua-space-for-all-of-us-setting-up-the-classroom-environment. jubbal, kevin. standing desks more harm than good?

"the drug combo extending lifespans by by anna poplevina jan, medium","modern medicine has made incredible strides in helping people live longer. but researchers arent just focused on adding years theyre looking to extend health alongside lifespan. a recent study offers a glimpse into what may be possible: combining two fda-approved drugs,trametinibandrapamycin, resulted in a significant lifespan increase in mice, while also improving their health in old age. researchers gave one group of mice trametinib, another group rapamycin, and a third group a combination of the two. the results were striking: trametinib aloneextended median lifespan by, depending on sex. rapamycin aloneincreased lifespan by. thecombination of both drugsshowed the most dramatic effects, boosting lifespan by in femalesand in males. whats more, the maximum lifespan (the longest any mice lived) increased significantly when both drugs were used together, highlighting their additive benefits. both drugs target different cellular pathways involved in aging: trametinibworks on a pathway that regulates cell growth. rapamycininhibits a pathway linked to inflammation and age-related diseases. by combining these mechanisms, the drugs created a stronger anti-aging effect than either could achieve alone. extending lifespan is one thing, but how did the micefeelas they aged? researchers found the drug combo also improved key markers of health: heart health:delayed age-related decline in heart function. tumors:reduced tumor growth and overall tumor load. inflammation:lowered inflammation in the brain and body. however, it wasnt all good news. some mice experienced side effects like fatty liver disease and testicular degeneration, raising questions about how these drugs might work in humans. both trametinib and rapamycin are fda-approved, but for very different uses: trametinibtreats certain types of cancer. rapamycinis used after organ transplants to prevent rejection. the fact that these drugs are already approved opens the door for further research into their potential as longevity treatments. however, what works in mice doesnt always translate to humans. animal studies like this are an exciting starting point, but testing in humans could take decades. scientists are now exploring whether combining even more drugs like diabetes medications metformin and acarbose could create an even stronger anti-aging effect. the goal is to target multiple cellular pathways to not only extend lifespan but also reduce age-related diseases. but before you get too excited, remember: its still early days. while these findings are promising, the path from lab to human trials is long and full of challenges. this study highlights the potential of drug combinations to unlock new frontiers in longevity research. while human applications are still far off, these findings show that targeting multiple aging pathways could be the key to living not just longer, but healthier lives. sources: study available at biorxiv. get simplified longevity research in your inbox once a week. its easy to read, science-backed, and delivered through my newsletter,longer. https:www.longer.mediasubscribe -- -- sharing simplified insights on longevity science, health innovations, and living a fuller, healthier life. founder of longer. www.longer.mediasubscribe help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"self discipline. how to quit addictions, diet, etc. by edburyr jan, medium","how to quit addictions, diet, etc. self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. all of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. if youve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. mindset is crucial in all cases. step : accepting that there is a problem. step : identify reasons for change.change is much easier if backed by good reasons. obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. if your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. this is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. however, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. step :ask yourself why you dont behave as youd like. understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. for example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. experiment until you find an approach that works for you. determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you dont behave as youd like. many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. where this is the case, youll often need to improve your mindset. one of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. witnessing others success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. also, finding out what they did can help. the most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. it can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. step : rules.establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. for example, lets assume youre tackling overspending. youve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. however, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isnt yet on your list and immediately buy it. a new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you cant buy anything youve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. if you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. they may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. if you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. this may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. you could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. when all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. we recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. during reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like google calendar). eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. step : understand the issue you are addressing. most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. were not suggesting that you shouldnt educate yourself about dieting; its just that the mental side matters more. some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. for such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. one way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. if youve experienced issues before, for instance, its unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. the best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. suppose your body language communicates boredom. it is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. a better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. in anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. further tips concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. for further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading kelly mcgonigals excellent book,the willpower instinct. robyn youkilissthin from withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. thanks for reading. my book,optimizing life, can be read for freehere i also offer personal online improvement-related coaching for per hour. please email me atedburyrgmail.comto book or inquire about groups or in-person rates. please also contact me if you would like a print copy of my book. -- -- help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the los angeles fires: the indictment of the fossil fuel industry by ken mcmullen jan, medium","on january , by photomotoman in political editorial share this! i am a retired fire chief, and former educator. for the last years of my year career in the fire service, i attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. it started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. that was years ago. it became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. and throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, ceos, caos, cfos, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. all ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. for me, my experience first began in earnest in , when fires ravaged northern manitoba, my province. i was contracted to the provincial government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. in my time off from being a full-time firefighter, i trained as sartec, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which i acquired privately by training outside the country. i also travelled throughout the north under contract. that year, fires forced the evacuation of , people across communities. however in , i resigned from my fire department in order to take a fire chiefs position in another province. i had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in british columbia where i had been, technically hired. that year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was million dollars. by the end of the summer, the province of british columbia had spent million dollars fighting those fires. in the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as i had already resigned my position, i took a position as the fire chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in ontario, canada in the region of niagara. after eight years, i found myself successfully hired as the fire chief for a jurisdiction in alberta, canada, that surrounded calgary, alberta. within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the rocky mountains and kananaskis provincial park. the fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. my attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. it is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over , wells drilled in . i often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? i will never know, but based on what is occurring in canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. they divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. as my contract ended, and i began a job consulting, in may , a forest fire surrounding slave lake, alberta, home to people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. the loss amounted to million dollars. five years later, in may , fort mcmurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of , structures. the loss amounted to . billion dollars, just in insured losses. a study from macewan university estimated total losses were in the range of billion dollars. in , canadas most destructive year to date, there were more than , fires, and mega fires, that burned million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in canada. experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. and then this year, jasper, alberta, one of the jewels of canadas national parks saw a fire burn , structures. none of these occurrences is normal. none of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. they are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. in , in lytton, bc, another canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. the temperatures for the last three years having exceeded c. at some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in canada in of . c or f. this is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. what does all this have to do with los angeles? this week audie cornish of cnn did a podcast. her guest was peter kalmus, a climate scientist for nasa. his former home, which was destroyed in the los angeles community of altadena, was one of the more than , homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, as a climate scientist, i knew it was time to leave los angeles, on january th, in the new york times. his personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire years he had lived in altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to durham, north carolina. he did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in southern california and nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. and this last week, he was proved right. what is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. yet, americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on fox and to the incoming president of the united states, a man who hasnt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. the problem according to kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. less than half of america elected the current president of the united states (.), yet this mandate enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. they are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. so, where is safe? one of kalmus beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, years ago, is daunting. much of what is to come, is baked into our future. of that, there is certainty. and whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. meanwhile, the question remains. where is safe? kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. climate change is global. obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the united states and canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. but ashland, north carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. so was lytton, british columbia. we are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. it will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. and because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. and none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- my name is ken mcmullen. im a retired director of emergency services and former academic. now retired, im an avid motorcyclist, photographer and blogger. help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

she thought. the establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. you can just give them , and theyll accept that, if you have it, samantha, who used a wheelchair, told melody. in a few days they went to lunch there with samanthas granddaughter and melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. she would be back definitely. over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay or not. she found out though that they did not want her five dollars. they wanted more and made that clear. two years prior, melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldnt afford to get another vehicle. because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. she was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. a friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment melody couldnt do the work. now shed been out of a job for four years, the longest shed ever been unemployed. melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldnt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. the other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but melodys injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. the third time melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. she found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didnt mind, except for this groups attitude of entitlement. melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. she was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. but a professional writerformer pet and house sitter also with years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. and some would ask her for money which she found laughable. the owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didnt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. he gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. this was not the person she was. now it was christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough shed had over a year that shed been on over medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. the allergist had given her the answer shed been seeking since last year regarding her condition it wasnt contagious, it wasnt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. whew!

"running until it doesnt suck: part by brigs h jan, medium","in which we land ourselves in physical therapy i have never used spreadsheets in my personal life. i dont create budgets, because i know what things cost and i know how much i make and i know how much money i need to have in my bank account on the first of the month. i rarely make lists. i dont write down my goals in journals. i dont wake up early if i dont have to. this wellness january or whatever the hell im having is honestly pretty off-brand. not because i dont care about my health, i certainly do, but because im sticking to notjustonebuttwothingsisaidiwoulddo!! here is a list of things that i have quit over the years (that i can remember): and here is a list of things that i have done for a respectable amount of time, to make myself feel better (that i can remember): as i have said before, unless its a necessity, i think life is too short to do things you dont want to be doing. like, people that read a bunch of books just because they want to say they read a certain number of books? those people concern me. ill finish a book if i like it. some people say thats a symptom of attention-deficit disorder, but i say its being human. friendly reminder that i am not a medical professional or a social media influencer, so i cant actually diagnose that. but here we are, days into january. still going strong on the no-alcohol front. stilltryingto go strong on the running front. im not really craving alcohol anymore, and im sad that im currently elliptical and cant properly run for the time-being. my last run was a treadmill run. my knees and my hip started hurting immediately. but my stubborn ass said, haha, no and i put on another episode of my zombie thing and kept running. despite the pain, i can confirm that run sucked quite a bit less than run . i was able to do my signature slow-jog for about minutes before i stopped, and i only stopped because i needed water. i even started to zone out a little, and think about other things. but now, in addition to fucking up my hip, i also have pretty constant pain my knees. since those things are all pretty important, i took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). i know pt is something i need to do because i need to make sure im not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. however i would much rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. ugh. or running shoes. but im making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. anyway, i now have a pt plan to help with the pain. and even though iknowit will help me feel better, i will certainly not be excited about doing it. im also an instant gratification human, which is another reason that long-term projects are hard for me. i find myself rushing through writing and rushing through art projects just because i want them to bedone.i try to take shortcuts. i dont take the time totrulycrease the origami paper, so my cranes always look wonky. i havent felt very inspired on the writing front lately. i know these running diaries arent very exciting, but they have been helping me stay motivated. there was no way i could publish a part one and not follow it up. i think ill hold off on updates until i run a k. im not submitting these to any publication, theyre kind of just going out into the etherbut hell, if it inspires justoneperson to try something they hate as much as i hate running, thats a victory. -- -- ai-free, anxious millennial writing since . future wine auntie. help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"
"why perfectionism is a hindrance? by maryam jan, medium","are you also a perfectionist like me? i always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. under too much pressure to be perfect, i was always an average student because instead of working hard, i kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. this all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. i knew i had to make a change. it wasnt an easy process, but i actively decided to find the solution. so, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that i can decide when to stop chasing for it. learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. in this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve hisher full potential. its the obsession that creates the problem. we just have to know the limits! do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know its probably unattainable? why do we do this? lets unpack that a bit. essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. it encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. from an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently perfect lives' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. the flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. this constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. nobody likes failing, right? sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. we always think like, if i aim high enough, ill minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing. this fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. the problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. excess of anything is harmful. our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. we are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. these images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. the pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. by meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. they may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. the ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. but sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. for some of us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. we believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. its a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though its often based on flawed assumptions. many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; its about earning approval and acceptance. -brene brown the pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. when were so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. we might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. as alexander pope aptly said, to err is human, to forgive divine embrace imperfection and recognize that its a natural part of the human experience. it also helps to reframe our definition of success. instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. did we learn something new? did we overcome a challenge? those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasnt ""perfect."" ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. by embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives. do comment if you liked the article and share your views on chasing perfection and excellence. thank you -- -- an aspiring writer help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the silent enemy: why cancer is smarter than you think by saad elbekri, md jan, medium","imagine you're sitting in a doctor's office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: ""you have cancer."" it's shocking. every day, , people face this same unexpected reality. most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: ""i felt perfectly healthy."" they didn't realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. i have some terrible news: you have a in chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. but wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. but here's the catch: it's far more complicated than it seems. even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting i've performed. and despite all our training and research doctors still don't fully understand cancer. cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body's defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine's biggest challenges. at its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. the real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don't follow the rules. usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body's police force your immune system and removed. even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body's defences. this buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. as the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. when the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. my colleagues and i can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. still, that's precisely for situations i'm getting paid for, and i like it. but here's where it gets tricky: cancer cells have a unique ability they can take highways through your body to spread. this process is calledmetastasis. there are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: at this point, treatment becomes more complicated. surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. metastasis no longer means the end it just means the treatment needs more personalization. but the big question remains. damage occurs when the cell's dna is altered. cell dna acts as the user manual for how your cell works. when that manual is damaged, the cell develops dna mutations, which cause it to malfunction. there are two ways a cell can get damaged: purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. it's like receiving an altered manual the moment you're born. cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of dna damage. sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. cancers show up much later. bad habits usually cause this type of dna mutation. for example (to name a few): those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell's dna, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. but cancer cells are smarter than you think. the more damage a cell accumulates, the more its dna gets altered. cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. it can now: it's like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. and here is how they do it. cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body's defences: yes. thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. but there's an even better approach: the best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. your health is worth it. take the first step today

"why soft skills matter as much as tech in digital health leadership by dr. ehoneah obed jan, medium","digital health startups are obsessed with technology, but what if the real competitive edge lies in skills that cant be coded? in an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ai-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices its easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasnt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. after all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary ai model is what attracts funding and headlines. but heres the catch: digital health is not just about technology; its about people. whether its convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. in fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the people side of the business. to be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. a leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. however, technology alone cant explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. its the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? or one who can design a wearable but cant address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? in digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but its time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code. communication, empathy, and relationship-building are not optional theyre essential. as we shape the future of healthcare, the question is: are we building leaders who can connect as well as they can innovate? -- -- digital health solutions architect pharmacist software engineer aws certified solutions architect associate content creator help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"healing humanity or modern eugenics? crispr determines the future of human evolution by shaelin gorny jan, medium","imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. a world where individuals dont spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like huntingtons disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. a world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. this is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. but alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. a dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where crispr places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. while genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. in ,chinese scientist he jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to hiv, resulting in the birth of twin girls(raposo). globally,. million people have died from hiv, yet with crispr, no more have to (hiv). while this trial showcased gene editings revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.the experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(what are the ethical concerns?). a clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. but what happens when scientific experimentation isnt strictly monitored? in the cases of thetuskegee syphilis study,henrietta lacks,nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: catastrophe. this same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. what happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.a study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(agha et al.). narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. however, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. this technology could end generations of suffering.genome mutations cause roughly , known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (using gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases). crispr technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as huntingtons disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. this technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable current treatment costs of . million reflect the high expense of novel technologies it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (pagliarulo and lucas). unfortunately, humans wont stop at disease eradication. if we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldnt we? enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. take theccr- mutation, which chinese scientist he jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(sanders). this mutation prohibits hiv infection, yetincreases susceptibility to west nile virus and leads to a higher overall mortality rate(sanders). this is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(accelerating global access to gene therapies). while disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. what may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. such pursuits are simply indefensible. what is the true cost of progress? when ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? well, lets review a familiar example. what did he jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? prison. reckless application of crispr technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. but on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? if genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. the stakes couldnt be higher.the world health organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(health ethics governance). without enforcement, these measures are futile. crispr holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. but if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. this isnt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. as a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing?

"the silent epidemic. understanding cardiodiabesity's threat by luis cisneros jan, medium","in discussions about americas most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. this complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. its a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. research by evernorth reveals a startling statistic: of adults in the united states suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. this figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. the rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. between and , adult obesity rates soared from . to .. if current trends persist, half of all american adults could be classified as obese by . but this is far from a superficial issue it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. the financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of billion annually. to put this into perspective, consider sarah, a -year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. over time, she developed type diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. sarahs story mirrors that of millions of americans. collectively, the costs associated with obesity ( billion), heart disease and stroke ( billion), and diabetes ( billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. these expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. while individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. social and economic factors account for of health outcomes, according to public health data. these include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability all of which shape an individuals ability to maintain good health. the physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for and , respectively. this breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. it is better to prevent than to cure. ibn sina the encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable and, in many cases, reversible. early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. a variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. take, for instance, the initiative led by cigna healthcare in partnership with virgin pulse. by allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. the impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. addressing cardiodiabesity isnt just a moral imperative its an economic one. companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. on a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. the stakes are enormous. cardiodiabesity isnt just a set of disconnected health problems its a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of american life, from families to workplaces to entire communities. this is not a challenge we can address piecemeal or delay for another generation. if we fail to act, millions will continue to face shortened lives, mounting medical bills, and preventable suffering. weve seen what coordinated action can do in the face of major health threats like cancer or heart disease. its time to bring that same urgency and focus to cardiodiabesity. the longer we wait, the more lives and resources we lose to a crisis that we already know how to address. this isnt just about statistics its about people, families, and futures that dont have to be cut short. the responsibility to address this crisis can no longer be postponed. -- -- ceo and founder of nudge health visit us atwww.mynudgehealth.com help status about

"why parents should include their children in organized sports by emory menefee jan, medium","why parents should include their children in organized sports its important that parents put their kids in organized sports while growing up as it has many benefits such as maintaining strong health, heightened concentration in school, as well as psychological and social benefits as they progress into adulthood. i can vouch that sports have shaped the person i am today and helped me overcome the obstacles i encountered while growing up. when my parents separated and went through the divorce process, sports were a pivotal outlet for me. it was an area of freedom and fun away from my outside life. as a young adult who has suffered from anxiety and depression since i was thirteen due to the things happening with my family, i can say without a doubt that sports saved me. many of my fondest memories and accomplishments came from being in sports, like scoring the game winning goal with thirty-one seconds left my junior year to be crowned the league champions with my soccer team. i dont get the best moment of my life without organized sports. for starters, physical activity helps maintain strong health. exercising is one of the best ways to keep children in shape and to help prevent diseases and illnesses. (national institutes of health, ). studies showed that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of injuries, different types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer, as well as reducing risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure. the american journal of preventive medicine said after school physical programs have reduced obesity the most. having your kids stay active would help reduce lower medical care as they would be healthier more often which also results in less financial burdens. as mothers and fathers, one of your main goals in life is to always keep your kids safe, and having kids in organized sports keeps your kids healthy which helps towards that goal. kids participating in organized sports growing up have shown to translate into benefits in the learning environment. a study that followed children from kindergarten to fourth grade showed that physical activities help children to develop and improve their cognitive skills. it has been associated with children getting better grades and doing better on standardized tests. physical activity has also been shown to improve attitudes and academic behavior including enhanced concentration and attention (gao, ). sports have always motivated me to have higher concentration in my academics to make sure i maintained solid grades. my parents would not allow me to participate in my sports if my grades werent good. that extra incentive while growing up helped me especially in middle school to stay focused and committed to getting good grades. those good grades alongside sports helped me get admitted into a selective prep high school. studies on the high school age group showed that teenagers who participated in sports are more likely to attend college and get degrees than non-athletes. studies have shown that sports can have beneficial effects on individuals even into their adulthoods, which explained that the benefits extend into the workplace. a survey of female corporate executives found that played a sport growing up and said it beneficially impacted their career success. (ey women athletes business networkespnw, ). additionally, physical activity has also been proven to have a positive impact on mental health and social skills. kids who are involved in physical activity have reported to have more excitement, more happiness and motivation in their day to day lives, whereas kids who are inactive reported greater nervousness, anxiety, depression, and worry. physical activity has been shown to boost self-esteem, leadership, and goal-setting skills. a study found that children who reported to have no physical activity in their life were twice as likely to have mental health issues. according to the united nations, sports have been proven to provide a safe environment and community for many participants. they may be having trouble at school or having issues at home. organized sports have helped kids find an outlet from their everyday lives. it helps unite these kids to learn how to work together in a manner that also teaches them to learn the value of teamwork and respect. additionally, it helps teach children at a young age to develop a passion for something. i fell in love with soccer and basketball when i was three. i developed many of the friendships and relationships i hold dear to this day. the community i fostered at a young age never faltered. i still reach out to old coaches i have had in the past for advice and guidance. i still keep in touch with old teammates and all of us wish each other success and happiness whenever we see one another accomplishing the goals we set when we were younger. i acknowledge that organized sports as the years progress the cost to participate also increases. theres a fee for equipment, travel cost, hotel and food. my parents paid for me to play club soccer from age ten to eighteen. countless practices and games. many tournaments required us to travel to different states. different jerseys, shorts, and socks each and every year. i agree that it can add up. when i spoke to my parents, i had asked them if they regretted any of it and they said no. they were just proud of where their daughter is today. citations: the mental health benefits of exercise.helpguide.org, childrens hospital colorado, oct. ,www.helpguide.orgwellnessfitnessthe-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise. psychological benefits of exercise.psychological benefits of exercise association for applied sport psychology,appliedsportpsych.orgresourceshealth-fitness-resourcespsychological-benefits-of-exercise. accessed jan. . youth sports facts: benefits project play.

"the cdc and department of health investigated my deadly case of botulism, and no one knows about it. by m. e. karty jan, medium","below is an unanswered, unacknowledged email i sent about my foodborne botulism case to a journalist in indianapolis, indiana . i almost died of food poisoning, was paralyzed and on a ventilator of two months, and it doesnt make the paper? no news outlets? not even a blogpost? are you kidding me? i am just now healthy enough to write about it. i am not going to shut up about it, because food safety will only get worse under this next administration. until i am dead, i will not be silenced. hello ms. xxxxxx, i received your information from xssss xssssssss, a colleague of yours. he thought you would be the person to direct this story. on august th, , my husband and i contracted foodborne botulism. after a night of violent vomiting and other gastrointestinal distress, things turned worse. within hours, i lost the use of my legs and had shortness of breath. my husband was vomiting as well and had double vision and we were both slurring our words. something deathly was wrong. we called my brother-in-law, a hospitalist md out of xxxxxxx, and he said to go to the emergency room immediately. my father-in-law from xxxxxxx happened to be in the area visiting his sister and took my husband to community north. we called an ambulance for me because i couldnt move and was gasping for air. we believe we were diagnosed with botulism in a timely manner because we went in together. by all looks of things, my husband, a fifty-year-old, looked like he was having a stroke. what we conjecture is that his symptoms along with my descending paralysis from the head down was how they caught it. by then, the paralysis had reached my diaphragm and i could no longer breathe on my own. by the grace of god and excellent medical care, a doctor recognized our combined symptoms as botulism. there is a test for botulism, and that takes four days. i think without intervention, i would have been dead within hours. the doctor called the cdc and an anti-toxin was flown in from chicago. the anti-toxin was administered, and we lived. my husband left the hospital, walking with a cane breathing on his own, in three weeks. my exposure must have been more extreme because i was a lot sicker. after two days of struggling to breath, i was intubated after what can only be categorized as a near death experience. i later had a tracheostomy and breathed through a tube in my neck for eight weeks. it took me a full twelve weeks to recover from the paralysis to walk and talk again. it has been five months, and i still have to walk with a walker. that is one heck of a story, right? so why is our case on the cdc or indiana health departments website? i called the indiana health department and they said there has to be at least ten cases in order for it to be worthy of public record. two cases of botulism are two cases too many. i understand because of hippa, that my anonymity is paramount, but so is public health. i am willing to out myself to bring attention to this deadly, but treatable disease. yes, botulism is rare and only deadly in five percent of cases, if it is caught in time. many of my doctors and nurses said they havent seen a botulism case in twenty years. that doesnt mean that there were unreported botulism because it was not diagnosed in time. undiagnosed botulism looks like heart failure or unexplained pnemonia. i was lucky and healthy enough to recover. i was lucky to have insurance and to live in indianapolis with access to top notch health centers like community north and rehabilitation hospital of indiana (rhi). i was lucky to have the forty pounds to lose in two months. i had no underlying conditions. you change one factor, and im dead of suffocation or heart failure in the first twenty-four hours, or im dead of pneumonia in two weeks. i am a miracle of luck and medical science, and no one outside of my inner circle knows about it. i want everyone to know about it. our food supply chain is already shaky because of monopolies, and i fear with the incoming administration and the overturning of the chevron decision that essentially weakened federal agencies, such as the fda, things will get worse. if my ordeal can make a difference, i am willing to forgo my anonymity for healthcare providers, legislators, and the public to know how to protect themselves when dinner turns deadly. i am looking forward to speaking with you. sincerely, m k botulism survivor -- -- help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"
"sit-to-stand desks: a small change for a big impact by margaret fennebresque jan, medium","with around of the child population overweight or obese and unable to read at a basic level, i think we can all agree that good health and academic optimization are two things america needs more of (fiorenzi;literacy statistics ). what if i were to tell you that there is a simple action that american schools can take that addresses both health complications and academic hardships? well, i hope youre on the edge of your seat because i want you to get out of it. thats right stand up, as my research has led me to believe that the solution is standing! american schools should transition to sit-to-stand desks to take advantage of the plethora of benefits to standing instead of sitting, ranging from hindering health issues like diabetes and adhd to cultivating academic success by improving mood and averting hours of unproductivity. tens of thousands of hours of every americans life is spent at school, and of this time is spent sitting down (leech;prepwise).sitting is the new smoking, you might have heard, and this claim is backed by findings linking health complications such as obesity, type- diabetes, and heart disease to sedentary time (fiorenzi). fortunately, standing desks, being on the path to movement, aids in combating each of such complications. standing burns more calories than sitting, averaging an additional calories per hour in adults, and studies have shown that obese or overweight children burn even more than their healthy-weight peers (fiorenzi). standing has been found to reduce blood sugar spikes after meals, a benefit especially helpful for diabetics but good for everyone since greater amplitudes of glycemic variability have been linked to circulatory oxidative stress (jubbal). standing is also connected with better heart health, as a study consisting of sitting and standing bus drivers observed that the standing drivers risk for heart disease was half of that of the sitting drivers (leech). if standing were to become the social norm, both the physiological perks and a new social pressure to be healthy enough to stand for longer periods would hinder health complications in the american school population. consistent with the correlation between better health and academic achievement, sit-to-stand desks provide users with a better learning experience by optimizing key factors to academic success, including productivity, mood, and attention (kurniawan;schmidt;valiente). one of the more obvious perks of a standing desk is postural improvement; good posture naturally reduces back, neck and sciatica pain (leech). according to astudy, patients suffering from chronic pain had an average reduction of . hours of work productivity per week. im not sure about you, but i can learn quite a lot in almost hours. a lesser known perk of a standing desk is its effect on mood: a positive one to be more specific. in one study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue and reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day and after returning to sitting desks their moods reverted to their original levels (leech). this study complements other research finding sitting and sedentary lifestyles linked with increased risks of depression and anxiety (leech). as a student, i can attest that maintaining a positive outlook has pushed me to take risks that have led to my own academic success. although you might have expected that standing desks would create distraction for children, i have found far more evidence suggesting just the opposite. i acknowledge that there is some anecdotal evidence documenting young children bumping into one another while using standing desks, however, recall that chairs create similar distractions including rocking, footsie, and leg swinging (the effects of standing desks). on the other hand, one study demonstrated that students using standing desks exhibited significant improvements in attention and inhibitory control compared to their sitting peers, and schoolchildren in the experiment group of another study that used standing-desks were found to be between and more engaged than the control group (fiorenzi;otto). dr. mark benden of texas am health science center school of public health explains this finding well: when kids sit at a desk all day, they dont have to use any energy, which means they can just as easily fall asleep, daydream, or distract themselves by distracting others (fiorenzi). at least for me, it ismuchharder to fall asleep standing up. considering that standing expends more energy than sitting, its logical that distraction would be reduced, a boon particularly for millions of american children diagnosed with add or adhd (fiorenzi). hopefully at this point, youre convinced that standing desks have immense benefits. you may still be wondering, though, is it worth the effort to replace all sitting desks with standing desks? allow me to clarify what i mean by transitioning to sit-to-stand desks. itd be a waste to toss out perfectly adequate sitting desks already owned, but i do think that when schools are in the market for new desks, they should purchase sit-to-stand desks. sit-to-stand desks allow users to adjust the height of the desk, giving them the option to sit or stand, thereby taking into consideration the needs of physically disabled children and providing flexibility for various activities. lastly, whereas the monetary price of sit-to-stand desks might be slightly more than that of a sitting-only desk, having the ability to make use of the numerous, substantial advantages of standing sure seem to outweigh that small cost differential. if you believe in having a healthy, educated population, i urge you to use your influence as a student, parent, teacher, staff member, administrator, or alumni to advocate for sit-to-stand desks in your school. dutta, sanchari sinha. sitting is the new smoking. news-medical.net, sept. ,www.news-medical.nethealthsitting-is-the-new-smoking.aspx. fiorenzi, ryan. benefits of sitting vs. standing for children. start standing, apr. ,www.startstanding.orgsitting-vs-standing-for-children. garcia, marta. a space for all of us: setting up the classroom environment.investigations, terc, nov. ,investigations.terc.edua-space-for-all-of-us-setting-up-the-classroom-environment. jubbal, kevin. standing desks more harm than good?

"the drug combo extending lifespans by by anna poplevina jan, medium","modern medicine has made incredible strides in helping people live longer. but researchers arent just focused on adding years theyre looking to extend health alongside lifespan. a recent study offers a glimpse into what may be possible: combining two fda-approved drugs,trametinibandrapamycin, resulted in a significant lifespan increase in mice, while also improving their health in old age. researchers gave one group of mice trametinib, another group rapamycin, and a third group a combination of the two. the results were striking: trametinib aloneextended median lifespan by, depending on sex. rapamycin aloneincreased lifespan by. thecombination of both drugsshowed the most dramatic effects, boosting lifespan by in femalesand in males. whats more, the maximum lifespan (the longest any mice lived) increased significantly when both drugs were used together, highlighting their additive benefits. both drugs target different cellular pathways involved in aging: trametinibworks on a pathway that regulates cell growth. rapamycininhibits a pathway linked to inflammation and age-related diseases. by combining these mechanisms, the drugs created a stronger anti-aging effect than either could achieve alone. extending lifespan is one thing, but how did the micefeelas they aged? researchers found the drug combo also improved key markers of health: heart health:delayed age-related decline in heart function. tumors:reduced tumor growth and overall tumor load. inflammation:lowered inflammation in the brain and body. however, it wasnt all good news. some mice experienced side effects like fatty liver disease and testicular degeneration, raising questions about how these drugs might work in humans. both trametinib and rapamycin are fda-approved, but for very different uses: trametinibtreats certain types of cancer. rapamycinis used after organ transplants to prevent rejection. the fact that these drugs are already approved opens the door for further research into their potential as longevity treatments. however, what works in mice doesnt always translate to humans. animal studies like this are an exciting starting point, but testing in humans could take decades. scientists are now exploring whether combining even more drugs like diabetes medications metformin and acarbose could create an even stronger anti-aging effect. the goal is to target multiple cellular pathways to not only extend lifespan but also reduce age-related diseases. but before you get too excited, remember: its still early days. while these findings are promising, the path from lab to human trials is long and full of challenges. this study highlights the potential of drug combinations to unlock new frontiers in longevity research. while human applications are still far off, these findings show that targeting multiple aging pathways could be the key to living not just longer, but healthier lives. sources: study available at biorxiv. get simplified longevity research in your inbox once a week. its easy to read, science-backed, and delivered through my newsletter,longer. https:www.longer.mediasubscribe -- -- sharing simplified insights on longevity science, health innovations, and living a fuller, healthier life. founder of longer. www.longer.mediasubscribe help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"men, read this before you lose a ball by alexandre levy jan, animated man","that is what the urologist told me as i lay on the operating table, wondering how it had come to this. then almost as an afterthought, she added:that is, if you get to keep them both. before you jump to any conclusions,i didnt do anything wrong.i didnt take a hit to the groin, try a weird yoga pose, or do anything unusual in the bedroom. it was a normal sunny morning, full of possibilities until it was obliterated by a sudden pain in my left testicle. at first, it was just a twinge, but every time i moved, it got worse. still, it wasnt agony. definitely notrush to the hospitalterritory. besides, i had plans. it was a big new years eve bash and nothing was going to ruin that. except, of course, my balls. in the end, the pain became impossible to ignore, and i had to tell my friends i couldnt make it out. luckily, they were supportive and one of them sent me a medical helpline number and told me to call. naturally, like anyone in need of an experts opinion, i turned to google. testicular torsion a condition where the spermatic cord twists, cutting off blood flow to the testicle kept appearing with urgent warnings to act within six hours. but id been in pain all day so i wastechnicallysafe. but that wasnt the real reason i didnt call right away the truth is, i have small, some might say (not me) ladylike hands. and i couldnt stop picturing dropping my pants and having my dynamic duo manhandled by some ogre of a mans giant hands, like a gorilla fumbling with cherries. so, i made the crucial mistake of sleeping on it.if it still hurts in the morning,i decided,then ill call the number. so, after a night of very little sleep and multiple testicle-related nightmares, i dialed the helpline. the medical questions came fast, and i was nailing them.no,i said confidently (and truthfully) to everything: swelling?no.fever?nope.the wrong colour?god, no. i was breezing through their questions, and by the time theyd finished, i felt like id just aced a maths test. are you alone?the lady asked, breaking my self-congratulatory haze.im with my parents,i replied.good, because you need to get to the hospital immediately!my stomach sank as she delivered the bombshell diagnosis:it might be testicular torsion. as i sat in the car, panic rising in my chest, i couldnt believe id let something as stupid as my fear of big hands keep me from getting help sooner. would i really rather lose a ball than let a big-handed man touch me? apparently, yes. and now i wondered if my hesitation had cost me everything. at the hospital, i found some small comfort in the fact that, so far, only women had been tasked with examining my precious cargo. first, a kind nurse asked a few questions, then a calm technician performed an ultrasound no sign of any gorilla-handed ogre-men. but then the results came back.you need to get to another hospital,they said.now. suddenly, i was in an ambulance, sirens blaring, racing toward a urologist who would decide the fate of my crown jewels. thats when it hit me: this wasnt a joke, and my balls werent going to wait for me to grow up and act like a man. at the next hospital, i met the urologist who explained everything to me in a calm, clinical tone like she could have been talking about fixing a leaky tap instead of performing surgery on one of the most fragile parts of my body. she described how theyd carve an incision down the centre and take a look inside for signs of necrosis. if it was alive and pink, theyd untwist it and tie it to the scrotum to prevent future torsions; if it was dead and black, theyd remove it. what if its in-between?i blurted, as i tried to haggle over my gonads like it was some sort of hostage situation.like, not dead, but not exactly thriving? she stared at me, unimpressed.if its alive, we keep it. if its dead, we dont. for a split second, i thought about suggesting,what if we just let it heal? maybe give it some vitamins?but deep down, i knew id already had my chance to save it. hanging on to a bad ball could mean losing both, and no amount of wishful thinking could change that, even if it was my favourite one. after one last round of negotiating, where i attempted to micromanage how theyd tie my man eggs to the sac, they gave me an oxygen mask and the sweet release of unconsciousness. i woke up groggy and in pain with one clear thought:ouch, my balls. wait myballs? id never felt happier to say that sentence to myself. the next day, as i was getting ready to leave the hospital, relieved to still have both my boy berries, a male nurse gave me one final check. his hands were massive. and yes, he manhandled my balls. it hurt. a lot. but as he squeezed and twisted my poor orbs, making sure the stitches were good, i realised something important: id rather be manhandled and alive than too scared to act and lose it all. i was one of the rare, extremely lucky cases. despite delaying my trip to the hospital, i walked away with both testes intact. but not everyone is so lucky. since my surgery, ive spent time onforums exchanging recovery tipswith other people whove been through this, and its shocking how many of them ended up losing a ball. one story stuck with me a -year-old boy who posted online that hed been in excruciating pain for three days and couldnt stop throwing up, asking,how do i tell my parents?by the time he finally sought out help, it was too late. he was lucky to keep one. its stories like this that remind me how close i came to losing mine and how shame has no place when your health is on the line. whatever fear or embarrassment is keeping you from seeing a doctor, its not worth the risk. trust me, if something feels off, dont wait. your balls deserve to be seen, touched, and manhandled. please welcomealexandre levyto medium. were glad to host his first story here on animated man. we appreciate how he tackled a serious mens issue with a sense of humor. we look forward to the next one! animated manis a publication with the focus on helping men understand and embrace all that they are or can be. if you have an article, old or new, that fits with this mission please drop us an email via thesubmissionslink. -- -- what is it to be man?

"self discipline. how to quit addictions, diet, etc. by edburyr jan, medium","how to quit addictions, diet, etc. self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. all of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. if youve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. mindset is crucial in all cases. step : accepting that there is a problem. step : identify reasons for change.change is much easier if backed by good reasons. obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. if your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. this is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. however, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. step :ask yourself why you dont behave as youd like. understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. for example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. experiment until you find an approach that works for you. determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you dont behave as youd like. many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. where this is the case, youll often need to improve your mindset. one of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. witnessing others success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. also, finding out what they did can help. the most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. it can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. step : rules.establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. for example, lets assume youre tackling overspending. youve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. however, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isnt yet on your list and immediately buy it. a new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you cant buy anything youve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. if you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. they may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. if you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. this may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. you could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. when all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. we recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. during reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like google calendar). eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. step : understand the issue you are addressing. most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. were not suggesting that you shouldnt educate yourself about dieting; its just that the mental side matters more. some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. for such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. one way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. if youve experienced issues before, for instance, its unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. the best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. suppose your body language communicates boredom. it is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. a better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. in anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. further tips concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. for further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading kelly mcgonigals excellent book,the willpower instinct. robyn youkilissthin from withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. thanks for reading. my book,optimizing life, can be read for freehere i also offer personal online improvement-related coaching for per hour. please email me atedburyrgmail.comto book or inquire about groups or in-person rates. please also contact me if you would like a print copy of my book. -- -- help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the los angeles fires: the indictment of the fossil fuel industry by ken mcmullen jan, medium","on january , by photomotoman in political editorial share this! i am a retired fire chief, and former educator. for the last years of my year career in the fire service, i attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. it started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. that was years ago. it became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. and throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, ceos, caos, cfos, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. all ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. for me, my experience first began in earnest in , when fires ravaged northern manitoba, my province. i was contracted to the provincial government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. in my time off from being a full-time firefighter, i trained as sartec, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which i acquired privately by training outside the country. i also travelled throughout the north under contract. that year, fires forced the evacuation of , people across communities. however in , i resigned from my fire department in order to take a fire chiefs position in another province. i had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in british columbia where i had been, technically hired. that year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was million dollars. by the end of the summer, the province of british columbia had spent million dollars fighting those fires. in the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as i had already resigned my position, i took a position as the fire chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in ontario, canada in the region of niagara. after eight years, i found myself successfully hired as the fire chief for a jurisdiction in alberta, canada, that surrounded calgary, alberta. within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the rocky mountains and kananaskis provincial park. the fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. my attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. it is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over , wells drilled in . i often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? i will never know, but based on what is occurring in canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. they divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. as my contract ended, and i began a job consulting, in may , a forest fire surrounding slave lake, alberta, home to people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. the loss amounted to million dollars. five years later, in may , fort mcmurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of , structures. the loss amounted to . billion dollars, just in insured losses. a study from macewan university estimated total losses were in the range of billion dollars. in , canadas most destructive year to date, there were more than , fires, and mega fires, that burned million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in canada. experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. and then this year, jasper, alberta, one of the jewels of canadas national parks saw a fire burn , structures. none of these occurrences is normal. none of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. they are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. in , in lytton, bc, another canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. the temperatures for the last three years having exceeded c. at some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in canada in of . c or f. this is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. what does all this have to do with los angeles? this week audie cornish of cnn did a podcast. her guest was peter kalmus, a climate scientist for nasa. his former home, which was destroyed in the los angeles community of altadena, was one of the more than , homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, as a climate scientist, i knew it was time to leave los angeles, on january th, in the new york times. his personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire years he had lived in altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to durham, north carolina. he did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in southern california and nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. and this last week, he was proved right. what is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. yet, americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on fox and to the incoming president of the united states, a man who hasnt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. the problem according to kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. less than half of america elected the current president of the united states (.), yet this mandate enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. they are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. so, where is safe? one of kalmus beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, years ago, is daunting. much of what is to come, is baked into our future. of that, there is certainty. and whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. meanwhile, the question remains. where is safe? kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. climate change is global. obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the united states and canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. but ashland, north carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. so was lytton, british columbia. we are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. it will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. and because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. and none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- my name is ken mcmullen. im a retired director of emergency services and former academic. now retired, im an avid motorcyclist, photographer and blogger. help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

she thought. the establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. you can just give them , and theyll accept that, if you have it, samantha, who used a wheelchair, told melody. in a few days they went to lunch there with samanthas granddaughter and melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. she would be back definitely. over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay or not. she found out though that they did not want her five dollars. they wanted more and made that clear. two years prior, melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldnt afford to get another vehicle. because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. she was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. a friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment melody couldnt do the work. now shed been out of a job for four years, the longest shed ever been unemployed. melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldnt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. the other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but melodys injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. the third time melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. she found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didnt mind, except for this groups attitude of entitlement. melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. she was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. but a professional writerformer pet and house sitter also with years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. and some would ask her for money which she found laughable. the owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didnt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. he gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. this was not the person she was. now it was christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough shed had over a year that shed been on over medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. the allergist had given her the answer shed been seeking since last year regarding her condition it wasnt contagious, it wasnt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. whew! she was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed melody. the manager took her name, and she didnt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. she couldnt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. no sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. hi, friend, he said insincerely. you seem like you dont feel well. melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didnt believe her. well, if you cant get that coughing under control you cant eat today, he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. she thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. the woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. the manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. so, once he walked away melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldnt see it. i know how it is, melody told the woman. i was in a group home before. so, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. now melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. as she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. honestly, it doesnt get any better than the mission here!

"why perfectionism is a hindrance? by maryam jan, medium","are you also a perfectionist like me? i always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. under too much pressure to be perfect, i was always an average student because instead of working hard, i kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. this all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. i knew i had to make a change. it wasnt an easy process, but i actively decided to find the solution. so, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that i can decide when to stop chasing for it. learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. in this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve hisher full potential. its the obsession that creates the problem. we just have to know the limits! do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know its probably unattainable? why do we do this? lets unpack that a bit. essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. it encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. from an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently perfect lives' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. the flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. this constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. nobody likes failing, right? sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. we always think like, if i aim high enough, ill minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing. this fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. the problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. excess of anything is harmful. our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. we are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. these images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. the pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. by meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. they may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. the ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. but sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. for some of us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. we believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. its a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though its often based on flawed assumptions. many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; its about earning approval and acceptance. -brene brown the pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. when were so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. we might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. as alexander pope aptly said, to err is human, to forgive divine embrace imperfection and recognize that its a natural part of the human experience. it also helps to reframe our definition of success. instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. did we learn something new? did we overcome a challenge? those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasnt ""perfect."" ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. by embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives. do comment if you liked the article and share your views on chasing perfection and excellence. thank you -- -- an aspiring writer help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"the silent enemy: why cancer is smarter than you think by saad elbekri, md jan, medium","imagine you're sitting in a doctor's office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: ""you have cancer."" it's shocking. every day, , people face this same unexpected reality. most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: ""i felt perfectly healthy."" they didn't realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. i have some terrible news: you have a in chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. but wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. but here's the catch: it's far more complicated than it seems. even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting i've performed. and despite all our training and research doctors still don't fully understand cancer. cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body's defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine's biggest challenges. at its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. the real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don't follow the rules. usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body's police force your immune system and removed. even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body's defences. this buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. as the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. when the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. my colleagues and i can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. still, that's precisely for situations i'm getting paid for, and i like it. but here's where it gets tricky: cancer cells have a unique ability they can take highways through your body to spread. this process is calledmetastasis. there are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: at this point, treatment becomes more complicated. surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. metastasis no longer means the end it just means the treatment needs more personalization. but the big question remains. damage occurs when the cell's dna is altered. cell dna acts as the user manual for how your cell works. when that manual is damaged, the cell develops dna mutations, which cause it to malfunction. there are two ways a cell can get damaged: purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. it's like receiving an altered manual the moment you're born. cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of dna damage. sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. cancers show up much later. bad habits usually cause this type of dna mutation. for example (to name a few): those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell's dna, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. but cancer cells are smarter than you think. the more damage a cell accumulates, the more its dna gets altered. cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. it can now: it's like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. and here is how they do it. cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body's defences: yes. thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. but there's an even better approach: the best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. your health is worth it. take the first step today

"why soft skills matter as much as tech in digital health leadership by dr. ehoneah obed jan, medium","digital health startups are obsessed with technology, but what if the real competitive edge lies in skills that cant be coded? in an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ai-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices its easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasnt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. after all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary ai model is what attracts funding and headlines. but heres the catch: digital health is not just about technology; its about people. whether its convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. in fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the people side of the business. to be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. a leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. however, technology alone cant explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. its the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? or one who can design a wearable but cant address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? in digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but its time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code. communication, empathy, and relationship-building are not optional theyre essential. as we shape the future of healthcare, the question is: are we building leaders who can connect as well as they can innovate? -- -- digital health solutions architect pharmacist software engineer aws certified solutions architect associate content creator help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"healing humanity or modern eugenics? crispr determines the future of human evolution by shaelin gorny jan, medium","imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. a world where individuals dont spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like huntingtons disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. a world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. this is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. but alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. a dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where crispr places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. while genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. in ,chinese scientist he jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to hiv, resulting in the birth of twin girls(raposo). globally,. million people have died from hiv, yet with crispr, no more have to (hiv). while this trial showcased gene editings revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.the experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(what are the ethical concerns?). a clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. but what happens when scientific experimentation isnt strictly monitored? in the cases of thetuskegee syphilis study,henrietta lacks,nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: catastrophe. this same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. what happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.a study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(agha et al.). narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. however, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. this technology could end generations of suffering.genome mutations cause roughly , known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (using gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases). crispr technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as huntingtons disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. this technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable current treatment costs of . million reflect the high expense of novel technologies it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (pagliarulo and lucas). unfortunately, humans wont stop at disease eradication. if we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldnt we? enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. take theccr- mutation, which chinese scientist he jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(sanders). this mutation prohibits hiv infection, yetincreases susceptibility to west nile virus and leads to a higher overall mortality rate(sanders). this is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(accelerating global access to gene therapies). while disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. what may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. such pursuits are simply indefensible. what is the true cost of progress? when ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? well, lets review a familiar example. what did he jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? prison. reckless application of crispr technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. but on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? if genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. the stakes couldnt be higher.the world health organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(health ethics governance). without enforcement, these measures are futile. crispr holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. but if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. this isnt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. as a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing?

"the silent epidemic. understanding cardiodiabesity's threat by luis cisneros jan, medium","in discussions about americas most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. this complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. its a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. research by evernorth reveals a startling statistic: of adults in the united states suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. this figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. the rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. between and , adult obesity rates soared from . to .. if current trends persist, half of all american adults could be classified as obese by . but this is far from a superficial issue it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. the financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of billion annually. to put this into perspective, consider sarah, a -year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. over time, she developed type diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. sarahs story mirrors that of millions of americans. collectively, the costs associated with obesity ( billion), heart disease and stroke ( billion), and diabetes ( billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. these expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. while individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. social and economic factors account for of health outcomes, according to public health data. these include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability all of which shape an individuals ability to maintain good health. the physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for and , respectively. this breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. it is better to prevent than to cure. ibn sina the encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable and, in many cases, reversible. early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. a variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. take, for instance, the initiative led by cigna healthcare in partnership with virgin pulse. by allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. the impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. addressing cardiodiabesity isnt just a moral imperative its an economic one. companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. on a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. the stakes are enormous. cardiodiabesity isnt just a set of disconnected health problems its a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of american

"why parents should include their children in organized sports by emory menefee jan, medium","why parents should include their children in organized sports its important that parents put their kids in organized sports while growing up as it has many benefits such as maintaining strong health, heightened concentration in school, as well as psychological and social benefits as they progress into adulthood. i can vouch that sports have shaped the person i am today and helped me overcome the obstacles i encountered while growing up. when my parents separated and went through the divorce process, sports were a pivotal outlet for me. it was an area of freedom and fun away from my outside life. as a young adult who has suffered from anxiety and depression since i was thirteen due to the things happening with my family, i can say without a doubt that sports saved me. many of my fondest memories and accomplishments came from being in sports, like scoring the game winning goal with thirty-one seconds left my junior year to be crowned the league champions with my soccer team. i dont get the best moment of my life without organized sports. for starters, physical activity helps maintain strong health. exercising is one of the best ways to keep children in shape and to help prevent diseases and illnesses. (national institutes of health, ). studies showed that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of injuries, different types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer, as well as reducing risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure. the american journal of preventive medicine said after school physical programs have reduced obesity the most. having your kids stay active would help reduce lower medical care as they would be healthier more often which also results in less financial burdens. as mothers and fathers, one of your main goals in life is to always keep your kids safe, and having kids in organized sports keeps your kids healthy which helps towards that goal. kids participating in organized sports growing up have shown to translate into benefits in the learning environment. a study that followed children from kindergarten to fourth grade showed that physical activities help children to develop and improve their cognitive skills. it has been associated with children getting better grades and doing better on standardized tests. physical activity has also been shown to improve attitudes and academic behavior including enhanced concentration and attention (gao, ). sports have always motivated me to have higher concentration in my academics to make sure i maintained solid grades. my parents would not allow me to participate in my sports if my grades werent good. that extra incentive while growing up helped me especially in middle school to stay focused and committed to getting good grades. those good grades alongside sports helped me get admitted into a selective prep high school. studies on the high school age group showed that teenagers who participated in sports are more likely to attend college and get degrees than non-athletes. studies have shown that sports can have beneficial effects on individuals even into their adulthoods, which explained that the benefits extend into the workplace. a survey of female corporate executives found that played a sport growing up and said it beneficially impacted their career success. (ey women athletes business networkespnw, ). additionally, physical activity has also been proven to have a positive impact on mental health and social skills. kids who are involved in physical activity have reported to have more excitement, more happiness and motivation in their day to day lives, whereas kids who are inactive reported greater nervousness, anxiety, depression, and worry. physical activity has been shown to boost self-esteem, leadership, and goal-setting skills. a study found that children who reported to have no physical activity in their life were twice as likely to have mental health issues. according to the united nations, sports have been proven to provide a safe environment and community for many participants. they may be having trouble at school or having issues at home. organized sports have helped kids find an outlet from their everyday lives. it helps unite these kids to learn how to work together in a manner that also teaches them to learn the value of teamwork and respect. additionally, it helps teach children at a young age to develop a passion for something. i fell in love with soccer and basketball when i was three. i developed many of the friendships and relationships i hold dear to this day. the community i fostered at a young age never faltered. i still reach out to old coaches i have had in the past for advice and guidance. i still keep in touch with old teammates and all of us wish each other success and happiness whenever we see one another accomplishing the goals we set when we were younger. i acknowledge that organized sports as the years progress the cost to participate also increases. theres a fee for equipment, travel cost, hotel and food. my parents paid for me to play club soccer from age ten to eighteen. countless practices and games. many tournaments required us to travel to different states. different jerseys, shorts, and socks each and every year. i agree that it can add up. when i spoke to my parents, i had asked them if they regretted any of it and they said no. they were just proud of where their daughter is today. citations: the mental health benefits of exercise.helpguide.org, childrens hospital colorado, oct. ,www.helpguide.orgwellnessfitnessthe-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise. psychological benefits of exercise.psychological benefits of exercise association for applied sport psychology,appliedsportpsych.orgresourceshealth-fitness-resourcespsychological-benefits-of-exercise. accessed jan. . youth sports facts: benefits project play.

"sit-to-stand desks: a small change for a big impact by margaret fennebresque jan, medium","with around of the child population overweight or obese and unable to read at a basic level, i think we can all agree that good health and academic optimization are two things america needs more of (fiorenzi;literacy statistics ). what if i were to tell you that there is a simple action that american schools can take that addresses both health complications and academic hardships? well, i hope youre on the edge of your seat because i want you to get out of it. thats right stand up, as my research has led me to believe that the solution is standing! american schools should transition to sit-to-stand desks to take advantage of the plethora of benefits to standing instead of sitting, ranging from hindering health issues like diabetes and adhd to cultivating academic success by improving mood and averting hours of unproductivity. tens of thousands of hours of every americans life is spent at school, and of this time is spent sitting down (leech;prepwise).sitting is the new smoking, you might have heard, and this claim is backed by findings linking health complications such as obesity, type- diabetes, and heart disease to sedentary time (fiorenzi). fortunately, standing desks, being on the path to movement, aids in combating each of such complications. standing burns more calories than sitting, averaging an additional calories per hour in adults, and studies have shown that obese or overweight children burn even more than their healthy-weight peers (fiorenzi). standing has been found to reduce blood sugar spikes after meals, a benefit especially helpful for diabetics but good for everyone since greater amplitudes of glycemic variability have been linked to circulatory oxidative stress (jubbal). standing is also connected with better heart health, as a study consisting of sitting and standing bus drivers observed that the standing drivers risk for heart disease was half of that of the sitting drivers (leech). if standing were to become the social norm, both the physiological perks and a new social pressure to be healthy enough to stand for longer periods would hinder health complications in the american school population. consistent with the correlation between better health and academic achievement, sit-to-stand desks provide users with a better learning experience by optimizing key factors to academic success, including productivity, mood, and attention (kurniawan;schmidt;valiente). one of the more obvious perks of a standing desk is postural improvement; good posture naturally reduces back, neck and sciatica pain (leech). according to astudy, patients suffering from chronic pain had an average reduction of . hours of work productivity per week. im not sure about you, but i can learn quite a lot in almost hours. a lesser known perk of a standing desk is its effect on mood: a positive one to be more specific. in one study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue and reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day and after returning to sitting desks their moods reverted to their original levels (leech). this study complements other research finding sitting and sedentary lifestyles linked with increased risks of depression and anxiety (leech). as a student, i can attest that maintaining a positive outlook has pushed me to take risks that have led to my own academic success. although you might have expected that standing desks would create distraction for children, i have found far more evidence suggesting just the opposite. i acknowledge that there is some anecdotal evidence documenting young children bumping into one another while using standing desks, however, recall that chairs create similar distractions including rocking, footsie, and leg swinging (the effects of standing desks). on the other hand, one study demonstrated that students using standing desks exhibited significant improvements in attention and inhibitory control compared to their sitting peers, and schoolchildren in the experiment group of another study that used standing-desks were found to be between and more engaged than the control group (fiorenzi;otto). dr. mark benden of texas am health science center school of public health explains this finding well: when kids sit at a desk all day, they dont have to use any energy, which means they can just as easily fall asleep, daydream, or distract themselves by distracting others (fiorenzi). at least for me, it ismuchharder to fall asleep standing up. considering that standing expends more energy than sitting, its logical that distraction would be reduced, a boon particularly for millions of american children diagnosed with add or adhd (fiorenzi). hopefully at this point, youre convinced that standing desks have immense benefits. you may still be wondering, though, is it worth the effort to replace all sitting desks with standing desks? allow me to clarify what i mean by transitioning to sit-to-stand desks. itd be a waste to toss out perfectly adequate sitting desks already owned, but i do think that when schools are in the market for new desks, they should purchase sit-to-stand desks. sit-to-stand desks allow users to adjust the height of the desk, giving them the option to sit or stand, thereby taking into consideration the needs of physically disabled children and providing flexibility for various activities. lastly, whereas the monetary price of sit-to-stand desks might be slightly more than that of a sitting-only desk, having the ability to make use of the numerous, substantial advantages of standing sure seem to outweigh that small cost differential. if you believe in having a healthy, educated population, i urge you to use your influence as a student, parent, teacher, staff member, administrator, or alumni to advocate for sit-to-stand desks in your school. dutta, sanchari sinha. sitting is the new smoking. news-medical.net, sept. ,www.news-medical.nethealthsitting-is-the-new-smoking.aspx. fiorenzi, ryan. benefits of sitting vs. standing for children. start standing, apr. ,www.startstanding.orgsitting-vs-standing-for-children. garcia, marta. a space for all of us: setting up the classroom environment.investigations, terc, nov. ,investigations.terc.edua-space-for-all-of-us-setting-up-the-classroom-environment. jubbal, kevin. standing desks more harm than good?

"the drug combo extending lifespans by by anna poplevina jan, medium","modern medicine has made incredible strides in helping people live longer. but researchers arent just focused on adding years theyre looking to extend health alongside lifespan. a recent study offers a glimpse into what may be possible: combining two fda-approved drugs,trametinibandrapamycin, resulted in a significant lifespan increase in mice, while also improving their health in old age. researchers gave one group of mice trametinib, another group rapamycin, and a third group a combination of the two. the results were striking: trametinib aloneextended median lifespan by, depending on sex. rapamycin aloneincreased lifespan by. thecombination of both drugsshowed the most dramatic effects, boosting lifespan by in femalesand in males. whats more, the maximum lifespan (the longest any mice lived) increased significantly when both drugs were used together, highlighting their additive benefits. both drugs target different cellular pathways involved in aging: trametinibworks on a pathway that regulates cell growth. rapamycininhibits a pathway linked to inflammation and age-related diseases. by combining these mechanisms, the drugs created a stronger anti-aging effect than either could achieve alone. extending lifespan is one thing, but how did the micefeelas they aged? researchers found the drug combo also improved key markers of health: heart health:delayed age-related decline in heart function. tumors:reduced tumor growth and overall tumor load. inflammation:lowered inflammation in the brain and body. however, it wasnt all good news. some mice experienced side effects like fatty liver disease and testicular degeneration, raising questions about how these drugs might work in humans. both trametinib and rapamycin are fda-approved, but for very different uses: trametinibtreats certain types of cancer. rapamycinis used after organ transplants to prevent rejection. the fact that these drugs are already approved opens the door for further research into their potential as longevity treatments. however, what works in mice doesnt always translate to humans. animal studies like this are an exciting starting point, but testing in humans could take decades. scientists are now exploring whether combining even more drugs like diabetes medications metformin and acarbose could create an even stronger anti-aging effect. the goal is to target multiple cellular pathways to not only extend lifespan but also reduce age-related diseases. but before you get too excited, remember: its still early days. while these findings are promising, the path from lab to human trials is long and full of challenges. this study highlights the potential of drug combinations to unlock new frontiers in longevity research. while human applications are still far off, these findings show that targeting multiple aging pathways could be the key to living not just longer, but healthier lives. sources: study available at biorxiv. get simplified longevity research in your inbox once a week. its easy to read, science-backed, and delivered through my newsletter,longer. https:www.longer.mediasubscribe -- -- sharing simplified insights on longevity science, health innovations, and living a fuller, healthier life. founder of longer. www.longer.mediasubscribe help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"men, read this before you lose a ball by alexandre levy jan, animated man","that is what the urologist told me as i lay on the operating table, wondering how it had come to this. then almost as an afterthought, she added:that is, if you get to keep them both. before you jump to any conclusions,i didnt do anything wrong.i didnt take a hit to the groin, try a weird yoga pose, or do anything unusual in the bedroom. it was a normal sunny morning, full of possibilities until it was obliterated by a sudden pain in my left testicle. at first, it was just a twinge, but every time i moved, it got worse. still, it wasnt agony. definitely notrush to the hospitalterritory. besides, i had plans. it was a big new years eve bash and nothing was going to ruin that. except, of course, my balls. in the end, the pain became impossible to ignore, and i had to tell my friends i couldnt make it out. luckily, they were supportive and one of them sent me a medical helpline number and told me to call. naturally, like anyone in need of an experts opinion, i turned to google. testicular torsion a condition where the spermatic cord twists, cutting off blood flow to the testicle kept appearing with urgent warnings to act within six hours. but id been in pain all day so i wastechnicallysafe. but that wasnt the real reason i didnt call right away the truth is, i have small, some might say (not me) ladylike hands. and i couldnt stop picturing dropping my pants and having my dynamic duo manhandled by some ogre of a mans giant hands, like a gorilla fumbling with cherries. so, i made the crucial mistake of sleeping on it.if it still hurts in the morning,i decided,then ill call the number. so, after a night of very little sleep and multiple testicle-related nightmares, i dialed the helpline. the medical questions came fast, and i was nailing them.no,i said confidently (and truthfully) to everything: swelling?no.fever?nope.the wrong colour?god, no. i was breezing through their questions, and by the time theyd finished, i felt like id just aced a maths test. are you alone?the lady asked, breaking my self-congratulatory haze.im with my parents,i replied.good, because you need to get to the hospital immediately!my stomach sank as she delivered the bombshell diagnosis:it might be testicular torsion. as i sat in the car, panic rising in my chest, i couldnt believe id let something as stupid as my fear of big hands keep me from getting help sooner. would i really rather lose a ball than let a big-handed man touch me? apparently, yes. and now i wondered if my hesitation had cost me everything. at the hospital, i found some small comfort in the fact that, so far, only women had been tasked with examining my precious cargo. first, a kind nurse asked a few questions, then a calm technician performed an ultrasound no sign of any gorilla-handed ogre-men. but then the results came back.you need to get to another hospital,they said.now. suddenly, i was in an ambulance, sirens blaring, racing toward a urologist who would decide the fate of my crown jewels. thats when it hit me: this wasnt a joke, and my balls werent going to wait for me to grow up and act like a man. at the next hospital, i met the urologist who explained everything to me in a calm, clinical tone like she could have been talking about fixing a leaky tap instead of performing surgery on one of the most fragile parts of my body. she described how theyd carve an incision down the centre and take a look inside for signs of necrosis. if it was alive and pink, theyd untwist it and tie it to the scrotum to prevent future torsions; if it was dead and black, theyd remove it. what if its in-between?i blurted, as i tried to haggle over my gonads like it was some sort of hostage situation.like, not dead, but not exactly thriving? she stared at me, unimpressed.if its alive, we keep it. if its dead, we dont. for a split second, i thought about suggesting,what if we just let it heal? maybe give it some vitamins?but deep down, i knew id already had my chance to save it. hanging on to a bad ball could mean losing both, and no amount of wishful thinking could change that, even if it was my favourite one. after one last round of negotiating, where i attempted to micromanage how theyd tie my man eggs to the sac, they gave me an oxygen mask and the sweet release of unconsciousness. i woke up groggy and in pain with one clear thought:ouch, my balls. wait myballs? id never felt happier to say that sentence to myself. the next day, as i was getting ready to leave the hospital, relieved to still have both my boy berries, a male nurse gave me one final check. his hands were massive. and yes, he manhandled my balls. it hurt. a lot. but as he squeezed and twisted my poor orbs, making sure the stitches were good, i realised something important: id rather be manhandled and alive than too scared to act and lose it all. i was one of the rare, extremely lucky cases. despite delaying my trip to the hospital, i walked away with both testes intact. but not everyone is so lucky. since my surgery, ive spent time onforums exchanging recovery tipswith other people whove been through this, and its shocking how many of them ended up losing a ball. one story stuck with me a -year-old boy who posted online that hed been in excruciating pain for three days and couldnt stop throwing up, asking,how do i tell my parents?by the time he finally sought out help, it was too late. he was lucky to keep one. its stories like this that remind me how close i came to losing mine and how shame has no place when your health is on the line. whatever fear or embarrassment is keeping you from seeing a doctor, its not worth the risk. trust me, if something feels off, dont wait. your balls deserve to be seen, touched, and manhandled. please welcomealexandre levyto medium. were glad to host his first story here on animated man. we appreciate how he tackled a serious mens issue with a sense of humor. we look forward to the next one! animated manis a publication with the focus on helping men understand and embrace all that they are or can be. if you have an article, old or new, that fits with this mission please drop us an email via thesubmissionslink. -- -- what is it to be man?

"beneath the same sky, bound by different faiths by monawrites jan, medium","in the quiet, fleeting moments of love, when two souls are drawn together like stars destined to collide, the world often seems to pause. their hearts beat in rhythm, as if they were always meant to find each other, to intertwine in a way that nothing, not even time, could undo. for him, a skeptic of anything unseen, and for her, a believer in something beyond the veil, their love was a fragile bridge between two worlds. it was beautiful, but it was also doomed. she wore her faith like a sacred mantle, each prayer, each word, a thread that tied her to her heritage, her family, her god. he, with his agnostic heart, questioned everything, trusting only in what he could see and touch. yet, in each others presence, they found a connection deeper than the constructs of religion. their souls recognized one another, something ancient and undeniable, a love that transcended labels and boundaries. but the world they lived in would not let them exist in peace. her parents whispered in hushed tones, their disapproval a cold, unspoken wall between them. his family, though silent, carried a quiet distance, unable to understand the gravity of a love they deemed impossible. they both knew the truth religion, that sacred force, was the unyielding barrier between them. no matter how deep their feelings, no matter how tender the moments shared, faith would always come first. in the end, love was not enough. they parted, hearts breaking under the weight of what could never be. she prayed for peace; he, for understanding. yet, neither could escape the excruciating pain of a love that was born to die, a love crushed beneath the weight of faiths unrelenting hand. the days after their parting felt like a hollow echo, each moment stretching longer than the last. she would close her eyes and see him, his face etched in the canvas of her memories his smile, the way he held her hand like it was the only thing keeping him grounded. and in those fleeting seconds of nostalgia, the weight of their separation would hit her like a physical blow. she would inhale deeply, hoping the scent of his presence would linger in the air, but it was gone, erased by the rigid walls of tradition and faith that both of them had tried so desperately to climb. for him, the emptiness was no less consuming. he wandered through his days in a fog, every corner of his world now devoid of the warmth she once brought. he questioned everything more now than ever before his beliefs, his doubts, his reality. was there a god? was there something greater than this aching void that had taken root in his chest? he could almost feel her her spirit, her soul out there, just beyond his reach. but faith, that ancient force that governed her life and so many others, had come crashing down between them, an insurmountable divide. what hurt the most was the silence that followed their love. it wasnt just the absence of her voice or the void where her laughter used to echo. it was the silence of understanding lost, the quiet acknowledgment that what they had wasnt enough, not in this world where love and faith couldnt coexist without causing a fracture. they had tried oh, how they had tried to find a way. she had hoped that love would bridge the gap, that the raw purity of their connection might challenge the chains of doctrine that bound them. but love wasnt enough when the very core of who they were her belief in a higher power and his rejection of it was in direct opposition. she would often catch herself staring at the stars, the same stars that once shone above them both in those stolen moments of joy. the night sky used to feel infinite, a reflection of the boundless love they shared. but now, it was just a reminder of the distance between them, a cruel reflection of the space that had grown between their hearts. in the dark, quiet spaces of the night, he too would look up, seeing only the expanse of the universe, but it felt colder somehow. it felt empty. love, he thought, shouldnt feel like this. it should have been enough. she should have been enough. but how could she be, when everything she held dear was anathema to everything he had come to believe? how could she understand his doubts, the gnawing questions that had no answers, when she was so firmly anchored in a faith he could never share? they had loved with a passion that knew no bounds, but now that same love felt like a cruel, unfulfilled promise. what was the point of all their whispers, their stolen kisses, their shared dreams, when in the end, they were destined to part, unable to break free from the invisible chains that bound them? the pain of that separation would stay with them forever, a scar that would never fully heal. because sometimes, love is not enough not when the world demands that you choose between your heart and your soul. -- -- help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"

"i drank turmeric, lemon, and hot water for days this is what happened by health remedies jan, medium","as someone with years of experience in the health field, ive seen countless trends come and go. but theres one simple ritual that has truly stood the test of time and has had a profound effect on my health: drinking warm water with turmeric and lemon first thing in the morning. its a combination that many might overlook, but i can tell you from personal experience that this powerful drink has had remarkable effects on my body. its not just about healthits about feeling energized, clear-headed, and vibrant throughout the day. i will fully explain how i prepare this amazing drink, for maximum effectiveness later below in this article let me take you through the incredible transformations ive experienced, and why i believe you should consider adding this to your daily routine. we all want clear, healthy skin, but what we often forget is that true radiance comes from the inside out. when i first started incorporating turmeric and lemon into my daily routine, i didnt expect to see such a noticeable difference in my skin. it wasnt just about reducing wrinkles or improving toneit was about feeling like my skin was nourished from the inside. now, almost every morning, as soon as i finish my warm drink, i feel a subtle shift, like my skin is thanking me. turmerics healing touch turmeric, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, has been a game-changer for my complexion. the active ingredient, curcumin, is a powerhouse of antioxidants, which help protect the skin from the inside. over time, i noticed fewer breakouts and a significant reduction in redness. as a woman in her mid s, ive struggled with occasional flare-ups, especially around hormonal changes. but since drinking turmeric regularly, those flare-ups have become much less frequent. i now have smoother skin, fewer blemishes, and it looks much more even. the reduction in redness, especially around my cheeks and chin, has been remarkable. i used to use heavy foundations to hide these blemishes, but now i feel comfortable going makeup-free and just letting my skin breathe. the turmeric not only works to reduce inflammation but also enhances the natural healing process of the skin. if youre someone who struggles with conditions like acne or eczema, youll understand the struggle of trying various treatments, but trust me when i say that turmeric is a natural, non-invasive solution. lemons collagen boost then there's the lemonrich in vitamin c, which plays a crucial role in collagen production. as we age, our bodies naturally produce less collagen, which leads to sagging skin and wrinkles. however, by drinking lemon water, ive found that my skin appears firmer and more youthful. its as if the lemon is helping restore the firmness and elasticity that i noticed was starting to fade. vitamin c not only boosts collagen but also fights free radicals that cause premature aging. for example, i started seeing fewer fine lines around my eyes and mouth. i have to admit, ive noticed that my skins natural glow has returned, and my friends often ask me what my secret is. the combination of turmeric and lemon has given me the radiant, youthful skin i thought i could only achieve through expensive skincare products. as someone who has experienced the highs and lows of different diets and detox programs, ive always believed in the power of simple, natural solutions. when i began drinking turmeric and lemon water every morning, it became a ritual that not only helped my skin but also had a positive impact on my entire body. i noticed how light and refreshed i felt, almost like my body had been gently reset. this is where the magic of detoxification comes in. turmeric and liver health the liver is your body's detox powerhouse, and turmeric has been shown to support its function. as we age, or even just due to everyday stress, toxins can build up in our bodies. in my experience, turmeric has been a great help in supporting the livers ability to break down these toxins. with the addition of this drink, i felt like my body was able to detoxify more effectively. i no longer felt sluggish or bogged down by the toxic load that sometimes accumulates. instead, i felt lighter, more energized, and ready to tackle the day. for example, after a long weekend of indulging in rich foods or alcohol, id sometimes wake up feeling bloated and sluggish. drinking turmeric and lemon water was like pressing the reset button for my system. it helped ease bloating and improve digestion, something ive truly appreciated. lemons role in the detox process lemon, with its high vitamin c and antioxidant content, adds another layer of detox benefits. lemon helps alkalize the body, supporting the natural processes of detoxification. over time, i noticed that i wasnt just feeling better overalli was eliminating toxins more efficiently, leading to improved digestion and fewer digestive issues. bloating and uncomfortable fullness, which i used to experience after large meals, became a thing of the past. i felt much lighter, as though my digestive system had been given the support it needed to function at its best. as someone whos been active in sports and fitness throughout my life, ive had my fair share of joint pain, especially as ive gotten older. i first turned to turmeric for its renowned anti-inflammatory properties, and ive been amazed at how much its helped with joint pain. after just a few weeks of incorporating turmeric and lemon into my routine, i started feeling a noticeable reduction in discomfort and stiffness, particularly in my knees and lower back. turmerics anti-inflammatory benefits curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, works by reducing inflammation in the body. chronic inflammation is one of the leading causes of joint pain, especially in conditions like arthritis. as i drank my warm turmeric and lemon water every morning, i began to notice that my joints werent as stiff when i woke up. in the past, i used to struggle to get out of bed without a few creaky moments, but thats no longer the case. there was a time when i would have to warm up slowly before any workout or even a simple walk. now, i dont feel the same stiffness, and im able to move more freely. my joint pain has been significantly reduced, and even my posture has improved because i dont have that constant discomfort weighing me down. lemons contribution to joint health lemons role in improving joint health is also significant. its high vitamin c content supports collagen production, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of cartilage in the joints. as i continued with this daily routine, i noticed that not only did my joints feel better, but i was also less prone to injury. collagen plays a vital role in joint flexibility, and drinking lemon water regularly helped me maintain that flexibility as i got older. in addition to all of the benefits i've already discussed, one of the most impactful changes ive noticed since drinking turmeric and lemon water every morning is a strengthened immune system. as a health expert, i understand how crucial it is to support the immune system, especially in todays world where stress and environmental toxins can weaken it over time. the combination of turmeric and lemon provides a powerful boost to your bodys defenses. turmeric and immune support turmerics anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties help reduce the strain on your immune system, allowing it to work more efficiently. ive noticed that since i started this daily ritual, ive had fewer colds and felt more resilient when the flu season came around. it wasnt just about preventing illness; it was about feeling more in tune with my body and less vulnerable to external stressors. lemons antioxidants lemon, with its high vitamin c, is another essential part of this immunity-boosting duo. vitamin c is known for supporting the production of white blood cells, which are crucial for fighting off infections. over the years, ive found that my bodys ability to fend off colds and viruses has significantly improved. i rarely get sick, and when i do, i recover much faster than i used to. the combined antioxidant power of turmeric and lemon makes this morning drink a must for anyone looking to stay healthy. another unexpected benefit of drinking turmeric and lemon water first thing in the morning is improved digestion. for years, i struggled with occasional bloating and digestive discomfort. but since incorporating this drink into my daily routine, ive found that my digestion has become smoother and more efficient. this, in turn, has had a positive impact on my overall weight management. turmerics digestive benefits turmeric has long been used to soothe the digestive system. it has natural carnation properties, which means it helps to reduce bloating and gas. for someone who has had issues with bloating after meals, this drink has been a lifesaver. it has calmed my stomach and helped promote regular, healthy digestion. lemons digestive boost lemon also plays a significant role in digestion. its acidic nature helps stimulate the production of bile, which aids in breaking down fats and improving overall digestion. after incorporating lemon into my morning routine, i noticed that i no longer felt weighed down after meals. instead, i felt light and energized, which made a big difference in my overall health and weight management journey. i even started noticing subtle changes in how my clothes fit, especially around my waistline, which i hadnt expected. this drink wasnt just keeping my digestion on track; it was also giving my metabolism a gentle boost every morning. by drinking this concoction on an empty stomach, i set the stage for my digestive system to function optimally for the rest of the day. its not about chasing weight loss fadsits about creating a healthy, sustainable routine that supports your body in the long run. if theres one thing ive learned from my experience as a health expert, its that energy and mood are deeply connected to your morning routine. starting my day with turmeric and lemon water has not only boosted my energy but has also improved my mood in ways i didnt anticipate. this simple drink gives me a mental clarity and physical vitality that sets a positive tone for the rest of my day. turmerics role in mental clarity curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, is known to support brain health by increasing levels of a hormone called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf). bdnf is like fertilizer for your brain cellsit helps them grow, repair, and function optimally. for someone like me, who juggles work, family, and personal time, this has been a game-changer. i feel more focused and less mentally fatigued, even on days when my schedule is packed. ive also noticed that my mood is more stable. there used to be days when id wake up feeling irritable or low for no particular reason. but after incorporating turmeric into my routine, i feel more balanced and resilient. its as if the drink helps clear the mental fog and gives me a fresh start each morning. lemons energy boost lemon, on the other hand, provides a natural and gentle energy lift. its high vitamin c content helps combat oxidative stress, leaving me feeling rejuvenated. unlike caffeine, which can cause jitters and crashes, the energy i get from lemon is steady and long-lasting. i also believe that starting the day with a warm, soothing drink has a psychological benefitit feels like a small act of self-care that sets a positive tone for the hours ahead. to make it relatable, think about those mornings when youre running late, rushing out the door with an empty stomach or just a cup of coffee in hand. compare that to starting the day with something nourishing and warm, like this drink. the difference is night and daynot just physically, but emotionally too. one of the most important benefits ive experienced from this morning ritual is improved heart health. cardiovascular health is something we often take for granted until theres a problem, but its crucial to take preventive measures. drinking turmeric and lemon water daily has given me peace of mind, knowing that im actively supporting my hearts health. turmeric for reducing inflammation chronic inflammation is a key factor in heart disease, and turmerics anti-inflammatory properties make it a natural ally for your heart. by reducing inflammation, turmeric helps lower the risk of arterial plaque buildup, which can lead to heart attacks or strokes. ive noticed that my cholesterol levels have remained within a healthy range since i started this routine, which is a huge relief given my familys history of heart issues. lemons role in heart health lemon also contributes to heart health in several ways. its rich in potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure. high blood pressure runs in my family, so this is something i keep a close eye on. by adding lemon to my daily routine, i feel like im taking an active step to maintain healthy blood pressure levels. additionally, the antioxidants in lemon help reduce oxidative stress, which is another factor in preventing heart disease. what i love most about this ritual is how simple and affordable it is. you dont need expensive supplements, fancy gadgets, or complicated routines to reap these benefits. all you need is turmeric, a lemon, and some warm water. its a wellness hack thats accessible to almost everyone, regardless of your budget or lifestyle. easy to incorporate into any routine for me, the simplicity of this practice is what makes it sustainable. whether im at home, traveling, or dealing with a busy morning, its easy to prepare. i keep a small container of ground turmeric and a few lemons in my kitchen at all times. on particularly hectic days, ive even prepared a small thermos of the drink to take with me on the go. theres no excuse not to prioritize my health with something this easy and effective. an investment in your health when i think about all the money ive spent on skincare products, supplements, and diet programs over the years, it amazes me that such a simple drink has delivered some of the most noticeable results. its a reminder that the best solutions are often the simplest ones. by investing just a few minutes each morning, ive made a lasting impact on my overall well-being. for those who are curious, heres how i prepare my turmeric and lemon water: . heat about a cup of water until its warm but not boiling. . add a quarter teaspoon of ground turmeric (you can adjust this to your taste). . squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the water. . stir well and drink it slowly, savoring each sip. for an extra boost, i sometimes add a pinch of black pepper, which enhances the absorption of curcumin, or a teaspoon of honey for a touch of sweetness. in my years as a health expert and my personal journey as a woman striving for better health, this morning drink has been one of the most transformative habits ive adopted. its more than just a beverageits a symbol of self-care, a commitment to my well-being, and a daily reminder that small steps can lead to big results. if youre looking for a natural, effective way to boost your health, i encourage you to try this simple ritual. whether youre aiming for better skin, improved digestion, or just a more energized and balanced start to your day, turmeric and lemon water can make a real difference. and who knows? it might just become the highlight of your morning routine, as it has for me. -- -- health tips, health

"why do chinese people drink hot water? by wayne shi the heritage pub jan, medium","two years ago, when i was on a business trip to sweden, my swedish colleagues were always surprised every time i took out my thermos and started drinking hot water. as many people probably know, apart from china, most western countries dont drink hot water. theyre more accustomed to drinking cold water directly, and there are reasons for this. in western countries, water purification systems are highly advanced, so the water that comes out of their taps is safe to drink directly. thats why i often saw my foreign colleagues drinking tap water in the office. nowadays, many of us in china also have bottled water at home, but one of the main functions of water dispensers is to boil water. people abroad, whether men or women, almost never drink hot water. even their coffee is often served cold. this habit, however, has led to health issues for many westerners. in fact, china has had a tradition of drinking hot water since ancient times. its not that cold water is undrinkable, but hot water is more beneficial for our bodies -- -- where stories of family history, traditions, and cultural identity come to life editor of follower booster hub tech guy as a senior cloud systems engineer. i also enjoy sharing what i have learned and experienced with others. help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"
"how could trumps policies redefine abortion access in america? by nia kullen jan, medium","the ongoing debate surrounding abortion in the united states has been deeply influenced by donald trumps policies and their lasting impact on reproductive rights. trumps presidency marked a turning point, with his administration prioritizing conservative ideologies that sought to reshape abortion access. as discussions emerge about trumps potential return to office, its important to evaluate how his policies could redefine abortion access in america. during his presidency, donald trumps administration implemented several measures that significantly restricted abortion access. his reinstatement and expansion of the mexico city policy commonly known as the global gag rule prohibited u.s. funding for international organizations providing abortion-related services or information. domestically, his administration rolled back title x funding for clinics that referred patients for abortions, leaving millions of low-income individuals with limited options for reproductive healthcare. moreover, trump appointed three conservative justices to the supreme court, cementing a conservative majority.this ideological shift culminated in the landmark dobbs v. jackson womens health organization decision, which overturned roe v. wade.states were given unprecedented authority to restrict or ban abortion, resulting in disparities in abortion access across the nation. conservative lawmakers and judges played a pivotal role in advancing trumps anti-abortion agenda. state legislatures in republican-controlled states passed restrictive laws, such as heartbeat bills and near-total abortion bans. many of these laws relied on the judicial support of trump-appointed federal judges, who often upheld the legality of these measures. if trump were to regain office, his influence on federal and state judiciary appointments could further empower lawmakers to pass even stricter regulations. this could potentially lead to the erosion of access to medical abortion, including pills like misoprostol, which is a widely used and safe method for terminating early pregnancies. healthcare providers and clinics have borne the brunt of restrictive abortion policies. many facilities offering abortion services have shut down due to legal hurdles, reduced funding, or fear of criminal liability. this trend could escalate under a renewed trump presidency, leaving women in states with abortion bans no choice but tobuy abortion pills online. the crackdown on abortion access has also placed significant pressure on providers offering medical abortion misoprostol. these medications are critical for women unable to access in-clinic procedures due to geographic or financial constraints. a potential trump presidency could result in stricter regulations, making it harder for women to access abortion pills safely and legally. trumps policies have already left a profound mark on abortion access in america. with his potential return to the white house, there are growing concerns about the future of reproductive rights.for many women, unplanned pregnancy will increasingly lead to seeking abortion pills online or exploring alternative methods, emphasizing the urgent need for policy reforms that prioritize healthcare equity. by examining trumps past policies and their implications, it becomes clear that the battle for abortion access is far from over. as the conversation continues, safeguarding reproductive rights remains crucial for women across the nation. -- -- hello, i'm nia kullen from florida, an mph graduate working on projects focused on reproductive health, pregnancy, and abortion to drive positive change. help status about careers press blog privacy terms text to speech teams"
