As someone in my pre-menopause phase, I realized that being overweight wasn’t just about how I looked-it was about my long-term health. I wanted to stay strong and vibrant for as long as possible, and I knew I needed to make a change. Here’s how I went from struggling to motivated and began transforming my health, one step at a time. When I first decided to commit to the gym, I’ll admit-it was hard. Pushing myself to show up every other day felt like a monumental task, but I kept reminding myself of my goal: to be healthier and stronger. One thing that surprised me was how inspiring it was to see other women at the gym. Watching them work so hard on their bodies motivated me to do the same. I thought, If they can do it, so can I. I’ve built a consistent workout routine that works for me: I start with 30 minutes of intense cardio, alternating between cycling and running. When I first began, I started slow and gradually increased the intensity. Now, I push myself to go harder, and it feels amazing to see how much stronger I’ve become. After cardio, I move on to weightlifting. My arms were very weak at first-I could barely lift 4.4 lbs (2 kg) in each hand, and even that was a struggle. But I stuck with it, doing 3 sets of 10 repetitions for each arm. Slowly but surely, I progressed to 6.6 lbs (3 kg) per arm. It’s not much compared to others, but for me, it’s a huge accomplishment. Pushups are still challenging for me. I can only manage 2 sets of 10, and even that feels like a battle some days. But I keep going, and I know I’ll improve with time. Because I’ve been cycling my whole life, my legs are much stronger. I can handle 66 lbs (30 kg) during my leg strength training, which feels empowering. Finally, I end my workout with belly exercises. I’ve worked up to 4 sets of 10 repetitions for my core, and it’s going well. I can feel my abdominal muscles getting stronger with every session. My diet was another area that needed a complete overhaul. I stopped eating junk food altogether and now prepare healthier meals at home. For example: I used to drink a lot of fruit juice, but I learned that it’s packed with sugar. Instead, I eat whole fruits or make smoothies. I only have a smoothie every other day to avoid consuming too much sugar. Drinking water has been another game-changer for me. I make sure to drink at least 1 liter of water daily, and it’s made a noticeable difference in how I feel. I’ve also reduced my screen time, especially in the evenings. After 9 PM, I avoid blue light from screens because it disrupts sleep. Instead, I wind down with a book or some light stretching. Sleep is so important for weight loss and overall health. I now aim for 8 hours of sleep each night, and it’s amazing how much more energized I feel when I’m well-rested. In just three months, I’ve lost 7 pounds. It’s not just about the number on the scale, though-it’s about how I feel. I’m stronger, more energized, and more confident. The progress in the gym, like moving up to heavier weights or running faster, feels just as rewarding as the weight loss itself. If you’re starting your own weight loss journey, here’s what I’d say: This journey has been challenging, but it’s also been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I feel stronger, healthier, and more confident than I have in years. If you’re thinking about starting your own journey, remember-it’s never too late to make a change. Small steps can lead to big results, and the effort you put into your health is always worth it. Let’s keep motivating and supporting each other.

Title : My Weight Loss Journey: How I Found Strength, Motivation, and a Healthier Me | by Donalana | Jan, 2025 | Medium
