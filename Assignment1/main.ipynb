My mom grabbed a vessel to collect the rainwater. She ran to the terrace and placed it on the beam. The rain stopped within a few minutes. I eagerly went to take the vessel but ended in dismay. I thought half of the pot would have been filled. Only 5% of the pot has been filled. Anyhow, I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste it. I wondered why we hadn‚Äôt considered tasting the rainwater all these years. I thought drinking rainwater would catch cold for me. I also believed that it would be tasteless or neutral. With all curiosity, I had a sip. Wow‚Ä¶ It was as sweet as the filtered water that we drank every day. It isn‚Äôt similar to that but possesses a unique taste. No water in the world tastes similar to rainwater. We install water purifiers at home to bring that taste. But, God has made it naturally without any water purifiers. His blessing has been instilled in the rainwater. I could drink only a very little as I had to share with my mom and aunt too. My aunt said that one of our neighbours cooks food only with rainwater. My curiosity spikes high to give it a try. -- -- 4 ‚ÄúReaders Club‚Äù is a reader-centered publication that delivers valuable insights across diverse topics.

      "{'Title': 'Self Discipline. How to quit addictions, diet, etc. | by Edburyr | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Edburyr Follow -- Listen Share How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

I thought half of the pot would have been filled. Only 5% of the pot has been filled. Anyhow, I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste it. I wondered why we hadn‚Äôt considered tasting the rainwater all these years. I thought drinking rainwater would catch cold for me. I also believed that it would be tasteless or neutral.

      "{'Title': 'Self Discipline. How to quit addictions, diet, etc. | by Edburyr | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Edburyr Follow -- Listen Share How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

We‚Äôre not talking about simple tasks anymore; AI is getting morepersonal, morecreative, and even a littleemotional(yes, AI has feelings now, sort of). So buckle up, because this post is about to dive into the quirkiest, most game-changing AI trends of 2025. Let‚Äôs break it down and have some fun while we‚Äôre at it.

      "{'Title': 'The Los Angeles Fires: The Indictment of the Fossil Fuel Industry | by Ken McMullen | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ken McMullen Follow -- Listen Share ON JANUARY 21, 2025 BY PHOTOMOTOMAN IN POLITICAL EDITORIAL Share This! I am a retired Fire Chief, and former educator. For the last 30 years of my 43 year career in the fire service, I attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. It started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. That was 32 years ago. It became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. And throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, CEO‚Äôs, CAO‚Äôs, CFO‚Äôs, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. All ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. For me, my experience first began in earnest in 1989, when fires ravaged northern Manitoba, my province. I was contracted to the Provincial Government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. In my time off from being a full-time firefighter, I trained as SARTEC, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which I acquired privately by training outside the country. I also travelled throughout the North under contract. That year, fires forced the evacuation of 25,000 people across 25 communities. However in 2003, I resigned from my fire department in order to take a Fire Chief‚Äôs position in another Province. I had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in British Columbia where I had been, technically hired. That year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was 54 million dollars. By the end of the summer, the Province of British Columbia had spent 554 million dollars fighting those fires. In the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as I had already resigned my position, I took a position as the Fire Chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in Ontario, Canada in the Region of Niagara. After eight years, I found myself successfully hired as the Fire Chief for a jurisdiction in Alberta, Canada, that surrounded Calgary, Alberta. Within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Provincial Park. The fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. My attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for 150 years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. It is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over 9,000 wells drilled in 2010. I often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? I will never know, but based on what is occurring in Canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. They divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. As my contract ended, and I began a job consulting, in May 2011, a forest fire surrounding Slave Lake, Alberta, home to 7000 people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. The loss amounted to 700 million dollars. Five years later, in May 2016, Fort McMurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of 2,400 structures. The loss amounted to 3.7 billion dollars, just in insured losses. A 2017 study from MacEwan University estimated total losses were in the range of $9 billion dollars. In 2023, Canada‚Äôs most destructive year to date, there were more than 6,000 fires, and 29 mega fires, that burned 41 million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in Canada. Experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. And then this year, Jasper, Alberta, one of the jewels of Canada‚Äôs National Parks saw a fire burn 1,113 structures. None of these occurrences is normal. None of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. They are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, in Lytton, BC, another Canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. The temperatures for the last three years having exceeded 41 C. At some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in Canada in 2021 of 49.2 C or 121 F. This is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. What Does All This Have To Do With Los Angeles? This week Audie Cornish of CNN did a podcast. Her guest was Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist for NASA. His former home, which was destroyed in the Los Angeles community of Altadena, was one of the more than 12,000 homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. Peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, ‚ÄúAs a Climate Scientist, I knew it was time to leave Los Angeles,‚Äù on January 10th, in the New York Times. His personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire 14 years he had lived in Altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to Durham, North Carolina. He did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in Southern California and Nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. And this last week, he was proved right. What is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on Fox and to the incoming President of the United States, a man who hasn‚Äôt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. The problem according to Kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. Less than half of America elected the current President of the United States (49.9%), yet this ‚Äòmandate‚Äô enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. They are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. So, Where is Safe? One of Kalmus‚Äô beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. Not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, 50 years ago, is daunting. Much of what is to come, is baked into our future. Of that, there is certainty. And whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the question remains. Where is safe? Kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. Climate change is global. Obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the United States and Canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. But Ashland, North Carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. So was Lytton, British Columbia. We are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. It will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. And because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. And none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- My name is Ken McMullen. I‚Äôm a retired Director of Emergency Services and former academic.

Eileen Chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. When they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but there‚Äôs no one they can depend on. Actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. Men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. But that‚Äôs not how it is for women. They carry so much more on their shoulders. They can pick up the weight, but they can‚Äôt put it down. It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work.

By Terri Rimmer | by Terri Persico Rimmer | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': \"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Terri Persico Rimmer Follow -- Listen Share The Heart That Matters By Terri Rimmer Shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment Melody‚Äôs neighbor Samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. Fantastic! She thought. The establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. ‚ÄúYou can just give them $5, and they‚Äôll accept that, if you have it,‚Äù Samantha, who used a wheelchair, told Melody. In a few days they went to lunch there with Samantha‚Äôs granddaughter and Melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. She would be back definitely. Over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay ‚Äî or not. She found out though that they did not want her five dollars. They wanted more and made that clear. Two years prior, Melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldn‚Äôt afford to get another vehicle. Because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. She was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. A friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment Melody couldn‚Äôt do the work. Now she‚Äôd been out of a job for four years, the longest she‚Äôd ever been unemployed. Melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldn‚Äôt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. The other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but Melody‚Äôs injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. The third time Melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something Samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. She found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didn‚Äôt mind, except for this group‚Äôs attitude of entitlement. Melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. She was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. But a professional writer/former pet and house sitter also with 40 years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. Melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. And some would ask her for money which she found laughable. The owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didn‚Äôt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. He gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. This was not the person she was. Now it was Christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough she‚Äôd had over a year that she‚Äôd been on over 19 medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. The allergist had given her the answer she‚Äôd been seeking since last year regarding her condition ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt contagious, it wasn‚Äôt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. Whew! She was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. Others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed Melody. The manager took her name, and she didn‚Äôt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. She couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. No sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. ‚ÄúHi, friend,‚Äù he said insincerely. ‚ÄúYou seem like you don‚Äôt feel well.‚Äù Melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didn‚Äôt believe her. ‚ÄúWell, if you can‚Äôt get that coughing under control you can‚Äôt eat today,‚Äù he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. She thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. The woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. The manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. So, once he walked away Melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldn‚Äôt see it. ‚ÄúI know how it is,‚Äù Melody told the woman. ‚ÄúI was in a group home before.‚Äù So, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. Now Melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. As she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. ‚ÄúHonestly, it doesn‚Äôt get any better than the mission here!‚Äù spouted a customer. -- -- I have 41 years of journalism experience having written for ten newspapers, some magazines, and web sites.

I don‚Äôt create budgets, because I know what things cost and I know how much I make and I know how much money I need to have in my bank account on the first of the month. I rarely make lists. I don‚Äôt write down my goals in journals. I don‚Äôt wake up early if I don‚Äôt have to. This ‚ÄúWellness January‚Äù or whatever the hell I‚Äôm having is honestly pretty off-brand. Not because I don‚Äôt care about my health, I certainly do, but because I‚Äôm sticking to notjustonebutTWOTHINGSISAIDIWOULDDO!! Here is a list of things that I have quit over the years (that I can remember): And here is a list of things that I have done for a respectable amount of time, to make myself feel better (that I can remember): As I have said before, unless it‚Äôs a necessity, I think life is too short to do things you don‚Äôt want to be doing. Like, people that read a bunch of books just because they want to say they read a certain number of books? Those people concern me. I‚Äôll finish a book if I like it. Some people say that‚Äôs a symptom of attention-deficit disorder, but I say it‚Äôs being human. Friendly reminder that I am not a medical professional or a social media influencer, so I can‚Äôt actually diagnose that. But here we are, 21 days into January. Still going strong on the no-alcohol front. Stilltryingto go strong on the running front. I‚Äôm not really craving alcohol anymore, and I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm currently elliptical and can‚Äôt properly run for the time-being. My last run was a treadmill run. My knees and my hip started hurting immediately. But my stubborn ass said, ‚ÄúHaha, no‚Äù and I put on another episode of my zombie thing and kept running. Despite the pain, I can confirm that run #6 sucked quite a bit less than run #1. I was able to do my signature slow-jog for about 15 minutes before I stopped, and I only stopped because I needed water. I even started to zone out a little, and think about other things. But now, in addition to fucking up my hip, I also have pretty constant pain my knees. Since those things are all pretty important, I took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). I know PT is something I need to do because I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. However I would MUCH rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. Ugh. Or RUNNING SHOES. But I‚Äôm making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. Anyway, I now have a PT plan to help with the pain. And even though Iknowit will help me feel better, I will certainly not be excited about doing it. I‚Äôm also an instant gratification human, which is another reason that long-term projects are hard for me. I find myself rushing through writing and rushing through art projects just because I want them to bedone.I try to take shortcuts. I don‚Äôt take the time totrulycrease the origami paper, so my cranes always look wonky. I haven‚Äôt felt very inspired on the writing front lately. I know these running diaries aren‚Äôt very exciting, but they have been helping me stay motivated. There was no way I could publish a part one and not follow it up. I think I‚Äôll hold off on updates until I run a 5k. I‚Äôm not submitting these to any publication, they‚Äôre kind of just going out into the ether‚Ä¶but hell, if it inspires justoneperson to try something they hate as much as I hate running, that‚Äôs a victory. -- -- AI-Free, anxious millennial writing since 2024.

      "{'Title': 'Self Discipline. How to quit addictions, diet, etc. | by Edburyr | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Edburyr Follow -- Listen Share How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

We‚Äôre not talking about simple tasks anymore; AI is getting morepersonal, morecreative, and even a littleemotional(yes, AI has feelings now, sort of). So buckle up, because this post is about to dive into the quirkiest, most game-changing AI trends of 2025. Let‚Äôs break it down and have some fun while we‚Äôre at it. Okay, picture this: you‚Äôre having a rough day, and your phone ‚Äî without any drama ‚Äî sends you a text that says, ‚ÄúHey, I got your back.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs not your BFF; it‚Äôs Emotional AI.

      "{'Title': 'The Los Angeles Fires: The Indictment of the Fossil Fuel Industry | by Ken McMullen | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ken McMullen Follow -- Listen Share ON JANUARY 21, 2025 BY PHOTOMOTOMAN IN POLITICAL EDITORIAL Share This! I am a retired Fire Chief, and former educator. For the last 30 years of my 43 year career in the fire service, I attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. It started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. That was 32 years ago. It became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. And throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, CEO‚Äôs, CAO‚Äôs, CFO‚Äôs, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. All ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. For me, my experience first began in earnest in 1989, when fires ravaged northern Manitoba, my province. I was contracted to the Provincial Government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. In my time off from being a full-time firefighter, I trained as SARTEC, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which I acquired privately by training outside the country. I also travelled throughout the North under contract. That year, fires forced the evacuation of 25,000 people across 25 communities. However in 2003, I resigned from my fire department in order to take a Fire Chief‚Äôs position in another Province. I had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in British Columbia where I had been, technically hired. That year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was 54 million dollars. By the end of the summer, the Province of British Columbia had spent 554 million dollars fighting those fires. In the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as I had already resigned my position, I took a position as the Fire Chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in Ontario, Canada in the Region of Niagara. After eight years, I found myself successfully hired as the Fire Chief for a jurisdiction in Alberta, Canada, that surrounded Calgary, Alberta. Within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Provincial Park. The fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. My attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for 150 years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. It is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over 9,000 wells drilled in 2010. I often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? I will never know, but based on what is occurring in Canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. They divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. As my contract ended, and I began a job consulting, in May 2011, a forest fire surrounding Slave Lake, Alberta, home to 7000 people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. The loss amounted to 700 million dollars. Five years later, in May 2016, Fort McMurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of 2,400 structures. The loss amounted to 3.7 billion dollars, just in insured losses. A 2017 study from MacEwan University estimated total losses were in the range of $9 billion dollars. In 2023, Canada‚Äôs most destructive year to date, there were more than 6,000 fires, and 29 mega fires, that burned 41 million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in Canada. Experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. And then this year, Jasper, Alberta, one of the jewels of Canada‚Äôs National Parks saw a fire burn 1,113 structures. None of these occurrences is normal. None of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. They are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, in Lytton, BC, another Canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. The temperatures for the last three years having exceeded 41 C. At some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in Canada in 2021 of 49.2 C or 121 F. This is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. What Does All This Have To Do With Los Angeles? This week Audie Cornish of CNN did a podcast. Her guest was Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist for NASA. His former home, which was destroyed in the Los Angeles community of Altadena, was one of the more than 12,000 homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. Peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, ‚ÄúAs a Climate Scientist, I knew it was time to leave Los Angeles,‚Äù on January 10th, in the New York Times. His personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire 14 years he had lived in Altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to Durham, North Carolina. He did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in Southern California and Nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. And this last week, he was proved right. What is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on Fox and to the incoming President of the United States, a man who hasn‚Äôt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. The problem according to Kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. Less than half of America elected the current President of the United States (49.9%), yet this ‚Äòmandate‚Äô enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. They are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. So, Where is Safe? One of Kalmus‚Äô beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. Not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, 50 years ago, is daunting. Much of what is to come, is baked into our future. Of that, there is certainty. And whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the question remains. Where is safe? Kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. Climate change is global. Obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the United States and Canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. But Ashland, North Carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. So was Lytton, British Columbia. We are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. It will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. And because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. And none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- My name is Ken McMullen. I‚Äôm a retired Director of Emergency Services and former academic.

Eileen Chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. When they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but there‚Äôs no one they can depend on. Actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. Men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. But that‚Äôs not how it is for women. They carry so much more on their shoulders. They can pick up the weight, but they can‚Äôt put it down. It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work.

By Terri Rimmer | by Terri Persico Rimmer | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': \"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Terri Persico Rimmer Follow -- Listen Share The Heart That Matters By Terri Rimmer Shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment Melody‚Äôs neighbor Samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. Fantastic! She thought. The establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. ‚ÄúYou can just give them $5, and they‚Äôll accept that, if you have it,‚Äù Samantha, who used a wheelchair, told Melody. In a few days they went to lunch there with Samantha‚Äôs granddaughter and Melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. She would be back definitely. Over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay ‚Äî or not. She found out though that they did not want her five dollars. They wanted more and made that clear. Two years prior, Melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldn‚Äôt afford to get another vehicle. Because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. She was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. A friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment Melody couldn‚Äôt do the work. Now she‚Äôd been out of a job for four years, the longest she‚Äôd ever been unemployed. Melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldn‚Äôt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. The other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but Melody‚Äôs injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. The third time Melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something Samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. She found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didn‚Äôt mind, except for this group‚Äôs attitude of entitlement. Melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. She was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. But a professional writer/former pet and house sitter also with 40 years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. Melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. And some would ask her for money which she found laughable. The owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didn‚Äôt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. He gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. This was not the person she was. Now it was Christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough she‚Äôd had over a year that she‚Äôd been on over 19 medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. The allergist had given her the answer she‚Äôd been seeking since last year regarding her condition ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt contagious, it wasn‚Äôt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. Whew! She was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. Others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed Melody.

Here is a list of things that I have quit over the years (that I can remember): And here is a list of things that I have done for a respectable amount of time, to make myself feel better (that I can remember): As I have said before, unless it‚Äôs a necessity, I think life is too short to do things you don‚Äôt want to be doing. Like, people that read a bunch of books just because they want to say they read a certain number of books? Those people concern me. I‚Äôll finish a book if I like it. Some people say that‚Äôs a symptom of attention-deficit disorder, but I say it‚Äôs being human. Friendly reminder that I am not a medical professional or a social media influencer, so I can‚Äôt actually diagnose that. But here we are, 21 days into January. Still going strong on the no-alcohol front. Stilltryingto go strong on the running front. I‚Äôm not really craving alcohol anymore, and I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm currently elliptical and can‚Äôt properly run for the time-being. My last run was a treadmill run. My knees and my hip started hurting immediately. But my stubborn ass said, ‚ÄúHaha, no‚Äù and I put on another episode of my zombie thing and kept running. Despite the pain, I can confirm that run #6 sucked quite a bit less than run #1. I was able to do my signature slow-jog for about 15 minutes before I stopped, and I only stopped because I needed water. I even started to zone out a little, and think about other things. But now, in addition to fucking up my hip, I also have pretty constant pain my knees. Since those things are all pretty important, I took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). I know PT is something I need to do because I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. However I would MUCH rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. Ugh. Or RUNNING SHOES. But I‚Äôm making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. Anyway, I now have a PT plan to help with the pain. And even though Iknowit will help me feel better, I will certainly not be excited about doing it. I‚Äôm also an instant gratification human, which is another reason that long-term projects are hard for me. I find myself rushing through writing and rushing through art projects just because I want them to bedone.I try to take shortcuts.

      "{'Title': 'Why perfectionism is a hindrance? | by Maryam | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Maryam Follow -- Listen Share Are you also a perfectionist like me? I always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. Under too much pressure to be perfect, I was always an average student because instead of working hard, I kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. This all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. üòî I knew I had to make a change. It wasn‚Äôt an easy process, but I actively decided to find the solution. So, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that I can decide when to stop chasing for it. Learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. In this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve his/her full potential. It‚Äôs the obsession that creates the problem. We just have to know the limits! Do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know it‚Äôs probably unattainable? Why do we do this? Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit. Essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. It encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. From an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently ‚Äòperfect lives\\' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. The flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. This constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. Nobody likes failing, right? Sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. We always think like, ‚ÄúIf I aim high enough, I‚Äôll minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing‚Äù. This fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. üçÇ The problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. Impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. Furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. Excess of anything is harmful. Our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. We are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. These images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. The pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. Many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. By meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. They may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. The ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. But sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. Also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. For some\\xa0of\\xa0us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. We believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. It‚Äôs a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though it‚Äôs often based on flawed assumptions. Many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; it‚Äôs about earning approval and acceptance. -Brene Brown The pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. When we‚Äôre so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. We might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. Ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. Continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. Celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. As Alexander Pope aptly said, ‚Äúto err is human, to forgive divine‚Äù Embrace imperfection and recognize that it‚Äôs a natural part of the human experience. It also helps to reframe our definition of success. Instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. Did we learn something new? Did we overcome a challenge? Those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasn‚Äôt \"perfect.\" Ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. By embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives.

      "{'Title': 'The Silent Enemy: Why Cancer Is Smarter Than You Think | by Saad Elbekri, MD | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Saad Elbekri, MD Follow -- Listen Share Imagine you\\'re sitting in a doctor\\'s office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: \"You have cancer.\" It\\'s shocking. Every day, 60,000 people face this same unexpected reality. Most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: \"I felt perfectly healthy.\" They didn\\'t realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. I have some terrible news: You have a1 in 5 chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. But wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. But here\\'s the catch: It\\'s far more complicated than it seems. Even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting I\\'ve performed. And despite all our training and research ‚Äî doctors still don\\'t fully understand cancer. Cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. Cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. Cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body\\'s defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine\\'s biggest challenges. At its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. Depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. The real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don\\'t follow the rules. Usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body\\'s police force ‚Äî your immune system ‚Äî and removed. Even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: Now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body\\'s defences. This buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. Initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. As the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. When the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. My colleagues and I can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. Still, that\\'s precisely for situations I\\'m getting paid for, and I like it. But here\\'s where it gets tricky: Cancer cells have a unique ability ‚Äî they can take highways through your body to spread. This process is calledmetastasis. There are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: At this point, treatment becomes more complicated. Surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. Usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. Metastasis no longer means the end ‚Äî it just means the treatment needs more personalization. But the big question remains. Damage occurs when the cell\\'s DNA is altered. Cell DNA acts as the user manual for how your cell works. When that manual is damaged, the cell develops DNA mutations, which cause it to malfunction. There are two ways a cell can get damaged: Purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. It\\'s like receiving an altered manual the moment you\\'re born. Cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of DNA damage. Sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. Cancers show up much later. Bad habits usually cause this type of DNA mutation. For example (to name a few): Those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell\\'s DNA, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. Usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. But cancer cells are smarter than you think. The more damage a cell accumulates, the more its DNA gets altered. Cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. Remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. It can now: It\\'s like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. And here is how they do it. Cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body\\'s defences: Yes. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. But there\\'s an even better approach: The best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. Early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. Cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. Your health is worth it.

Recently, Trump announced a major boost for AI infrastructure in the United States, with private companies planning to invest up to $500 billion over the next four years. A new venture, calledStargate, is being launched by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, according to sources familiar with the deal. Leaders from these companies, including SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman, and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, are expected to join Trump at the White House to make the announcement. The partnership will begin with a $100 billion investment and start its first project ‚Äî a data center in Texas. The plan is to expand to other states over time. Other investors are expected to join, though their identities have not yet been revealed. Stargate aims to create cutting-edge infrastructure to support AI development in the U.S. While spokespeople for SoftBank and OpenAI have not commented, this massive initiative signals a strong push to position the U.S. as a leader in AI technology. Which means AI gets funded, and every crazy idea of AI can be a reality of our future.

Animals like dairy cattle, wild birds, poultry flocks, and different mammals, like cats and bears, have detected the flu. There has been no person-to-person spread and the public health risk is low; with only 67 confirmed cases in the US. However, there was one person who recently died from the bird flu. On January 6, 2025, the Louisiana Department of Health announced that since December, there‚Äôs been one patient who has been hospitalized from the bird flu. That patient was the first to die in the US. Samples were taken from the patient and it turns out that the virus mutated after the infection.

In the late 19th century, international efforts to combat diseases like cholera and yellow fever laid the groundwork for cooperation across borders. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the aftermath of World War II that global leaders recognized the need for a central organization to address health issues on a worldwide scale. TheWHOwas officially established on April 7, 1948, a date now celebrated annually as World Health Day. With 61 countries signing its constitution, the WHO marked the beginning of a unified approach to tackling global health challenges. The WHO‚Äôs vision is ambitious yet simple: ‚ÄúHealth for All.‚Äù This encapsulates its mission to ensure that all people have access to essential healthcare services without suffering financial hardship. Its objectives include: The WHO emphasizes collaboration, working with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders to achieve its goals. TheWorld Health Organization‚Äôs work spans a broad spectrum of activities aimed at improving global health. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key functions: The WHO develops guidelines and standards that influence health practices worldwide. For example, it publishes the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a critical tool for tracking and diagnosing diseases. The WHO plays a pivotal role in eradicating and controlling infectious diseases. Its notable successes include the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and its ongoing efforts to eliminate polio. The organization also leads campaigns against malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, providing funding, resources, and technical expertise. During health crises such as pandemics, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks, the WHO steps in to coordinate international responses. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO distributed over 1 billion doses of vaccines through the COVAX initiative, saving countless lives. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are leading causes of death globally. The WHO advocates for preventive measures, such as reducing tobacco use, encouraging physical activity, and promoting healthy diets. The WHO is committed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. Through programs like the Every Woman Every Child initiative, it ensures better access to prenatal care, safe childbirth, and nutrition for mothers and children. Recognizing mental health as an integral part of overall well-being, the WHO works to destigmatize mental illness and improve access to mental health services. Its global mental health action plan emphasizes the need for early intervention and support systems. One of the WHO‚Äôs most celebrated accomplishments is the eradication of smallpox. Through a coordinated vaccination campaign, the disease was officially declared eradicated in 1980, saving millions of lives. Although polio remains endemic in a few regions, the WHO‚Äôs Global Polio Eradication Initiative has brought the world closer to eradicating this crippling disease. For example, cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988. The WHO has been instrumental in the fight against HIV/AIDS. By advocating for antiretroviral therapy and prevention programs, it has significantly reduced the disease‚Äôs impact in many countries.Read More -- -- <a href=\"https://www.myreview24.com/\"> Read Movie Reviews, Entertainment News, Home & Kitchen, Net Worth, News, Trending Topics, Fashion and more</a> Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams'}\n",

Treasuring thefirsttime seeing the result of his labor from whacking thick pods with a knife and piling the milky beans in a heap before drying later for shipment, an older guy, as he sat among workers, mostly in flip-flops and dingy shirts, held the unwrapped chocolate bar up to talk, basking in his moment of glory. Impatiently, their hands reached out until he mentioned his obligation as the eldest to taste what the stranger had given him. When he finally indulged himself, the sweetness immediately spread across his lips into a smile. Earlier, another laborer, prompted by a flashing notion, had shared what he thought with others, one of several comments the group associated with eating chocolate. ‚ÄúThis is why white people are so healthy.‚Äù Saving the wrapper in his pocket after passing the rest to others, the eldest there declared that he would take it home to show to his family, so proud of his discovery of chocolate, a delicacy forcenturiesin many parts of the world, especially oncecompaniespoured in enough milk and sugar to keep dentists and physicians in business, as patients succumbed to cavities and a litany of diseases from obesity. Count me as one of the many who enjoyed those delectable desires sweetened for addiction. Switching over gradually to the kind without any added sweetness took years before I got used to the taste. Even now, I chase that bitterness down with a banana or a pinch of raisins and constantly keep an eye on the scale, adjusting daily desires by the ounce, because I treasure good health. Otherwise, I‚Äôd eat up a few sizes from all the frigid temperatures that have kept me in this season. Jazzed bysnow, the most, from what I read online, since Valentine‚Äôs of 1895, Fat Tuesday came early for strollers in New Orleans, as unseemly weather shut down the city, while also giving mothers a reason to celebrate with their kids who, like that guy tasting chocolate first, smiled wide at the sight of soft mounds piling atop cars and layering lawns everywhere ‚Äî a memory imprinted forever in a treasured click for a photo album, adding to the joy from a day off from schoolwork. First times, as well as final ones, occupy a special place that we embrace more emotionally than whatever happened before or afterward ‚Äî whether in a tasted desire or prized memory. Memories of those first moments often last throughout life, adding layers of context for comparison as we mature and grow through the years. Once we add similar moments, that original impression slowly depreciates until it loses its luster, the charm of what made it precious in the first place. Eyes that once dazzled look elsewhere now at a dinner table. Instead of connecting deeply to refresh the feeling that we promised to hold on to forever, we slip into going through the motions of just another habit ‚Äî a hug without meaning more, just another piece of chocolate for our lips. Valentine‚Äôs Day, as well as a couple of other days throughout the year, particularly the annual sale of Leonidas Chocolate, usually brings on an urge for me to resist perhaps my favorite temptation for a delicacy. However, a frozen winter of singleness has one advantage going for it ‚Äî buying less processed chocolate to sprinkle in for a random occasion, especially with fewer bouquets of scented petals that wilt by the week. Despite missing out on delectable treats that whet my appetite each year, I manage to flavor bitter nibs daily and savor them with fruit to suit my taste. Consequently, I refresh an edible joy that keeps me coming back for more each day, though rather hard-pressed to remember that first taste of chocolate ever. If I reacted similarly to the man in the video after that first bite of chocolate, my impression faded quickly amid sweetness packaged on shelves easily within reach, perhaps in preparing me for a world filled with irresistible eye candy often painted on lips. This morning‚Äôs reading treasures wisdom that knows which desires mean more and which pleasures require greater self-discipline. Each day, we encounter a new opportunity to improve on the day before or just drift back to the pack of mediocrity ‚Äî that first nibble for a taste of what lies ahead or fresh snow for a memory in years to come.

In an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ‚Äî AI-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. Yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasn‚Äôt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. Many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. After all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary AI model is what attracts funding and headlines. But here‚Äôs the catch: digital health is not just about technology; it‚Äôs about people. Whether it‚Äôs convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. In fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô side of the business. To be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. A leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. However, technology alone can‚Äôt explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. It‚Äôs the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. Think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? Or one who can design a wearable but can‚Äôt address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? In digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. Technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but it‚Äôs time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code.

The dye was alreadybanned in 1990in cosmetics for causing cancer in lab rats who ingested it. Fast forward 35 years, to yesterday, when it is finally banned in food, when we knew all along it caused cancer ifeaten. It was also‚Äúrestricted‚Äùin the EU in 1994, with allowance in cocktail cherries, aka Maraschino cherries. Maraschino cherries ‚Äî a preserved, candied cherry,originally never used dye in the first place. Created in Europe, the spirit companyLuxardo(who claims ownership), released them in 1821, using alcohol and sugar as the preservative. Eventually the cherries made their way to the US and then prohibition happened. in the 1920s, a professor in Oregon created his own version using calcium salts and brine as a preservative, which removed the coloring, so he added back coloring, artificially, giving them their bright red color. This colorant was banned in the 60s for causing cancer, so manufacturers started using another artificial colorant ‚Äî Red 40, which also causes cancer and neurological issues in humans. Red 40 is still used today in Maraschino cherries and many other foods and drinks and cosmetics. Let‚Äôs review. I am going to make this short and sweet. Just like us, large organizations, governments, charities, corporations also want self preservation, but the want it for the ‚Äúorganizations‚Äù interest aka the shareholders/stakeholders. They may employ humans like you and me, but they employ them to work on their behalf. Why do humans comply? The paycheck they receive serves their own self-interests enough to make them do things they know are not benefiting others. Nothing will change until we demand it. Power is never given back, and rarely is money. If we want to take our power back, we need to take power away from entities who are not protecting us.

      "{'Title': 'Healing Humanity or Modern Eugenics? CRISPR Determines the Future of Human Evolution | by Shaelin Gorny | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shaelin Gorny Follow -- Listen Share Imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. A world where individuals don‚Äôt spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like Huntington‚Äôs disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. A world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. This is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. But alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. A dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where CRISPR places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. While genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. In 2018,Chinese scientist He Jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to HIV, resulting in the birth of twin girls(Raposo). Globally,42.3 million people have died from HIV, yet with CRISPR, no more have to (‚ÄúHIV‚Äù). While this trial showcased gene editing‚Äôs revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.The experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(‚ÄúWhat are the Ethical Concerns‚Ä¶?‚Äù). A clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. But what happens when scientific experimentation isn‚Äôt strictly monitored? In the cases of theTuskegee Syphilis Study,Henrietta Lacks,Nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: Catastrophe. This same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of Nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. What happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? Prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them ‚Äî a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. Evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.A 2018 study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens‚Äô adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(Agha et al.). Narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. However, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. This technology could end generations of suffering.Genome mutations cause roughly 7,000 known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (‚ÄúUsing gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases‚Äù). CRISPR technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as Huntington‚Äôs disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable ‚Äîcurrent treatment costs of $2.2 million reflect the high expense of novel technologies‚Äî it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (Pagliarulo and Lucas). Unfortunately, humans won‚Äôt stop at disease eradication. If we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldn‚Äôt we? Enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. Targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. Take theCCR5-Œî32 mutation, which Chinese scientist He Jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(Sanders). This mutation prohibits HIV infection, yetincreases susceptibility to West Nile virus and leads to a 21% higher overall mortality rate(Sanders). This is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. Eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. Additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(‚ÄúAccelerating Global Access to Gene Therapies‚Äù). While disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. Enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. What may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. Such pursuits are simply indefensible. What is the true cost of progress? When ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? Well, let‚Äôs review a familiar example. What did He Jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? Prison. Reckless application of CRISPR technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. But on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? If genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist ‚Äî it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.The World Health Organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(‚ÄúHealth Ethics & Governance‚Äù). Without enforcement, these measures are futile. CRISPR holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. But if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. This isn‚Äôt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. As a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing? The choice ‚Äî and the responsibility ‚Äî belongs to all of us.

      "{'Title': \"The Silent Epidemic. Understanding Cardiodiabesity's Threat‚Ä¶ | by Luis Cisneros | Jan, 2025 | Medium\", 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Luis Cisneros Follow -- 1 Listen Share In discussions about America‚Äôs most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. Yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. This complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. It‚Äôs a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Research by Evernorth reveals a startling statistic: 93% of adults in the United States suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. This figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. The rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. Between 1999 and 2020, adult obesity rates soared from 30.5% to 41.9%. If current trends persist, half of all American adults could be classified as obese by 2030. But this is far from a superficial issue ‚Äì it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of $719 billion annually. To put this into perspective, consider Sarah, a 45-year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. Her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. Over time, she developed type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. Sarah‚Äôs story mirrors that of millions of Americans. Collectively, the costs associated with obesity ($173 billion), heart disease and stroke ($219 billion), and diabetes ($327 billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. These expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity ‚Äì making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. While individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. Social and economic factors account for 40% of health outcomes, according to public health data. These include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability ‚Äì all of which shape an individual‚Äôs ability to maintain good health. The physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (10%), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for 20% and 30%, respectively. This breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. ‚ÄúIt is better to prevent than to cure. ‚Äì Ibn Sina‚Äù The encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable ‚Äì and, in many cases, reversible. Early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. A variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. Take, for instance, the initiative led by Cigna Healthcare in partnership with Virgin Pulse. By allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. Statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. Families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. The impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. Addressing cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a moral imperative ‚Äì it‚Äôs an economic one. Companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. On a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. Much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. Healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. Integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. The stakes are enormous. Cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a set of disconnected health problems ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of American life, from families to workplaces to entire communities. This is not a challenge we can address piecemeal or delay for another generation. If we fail to act, millions will continue to face shortened lives, mounting medical bills, and preventable suffering. We‚Äôve seen what coordinated action can do in the face of major health threats like cancer or heart disease. It‚Äôs time to bring that same urgency and focus to cardiodiabesity. The longer we wait, the more lives and resources we lose to a crisis that we already know how to address. This isn‚Äôt just about statistics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about people, families, and futures that don‚Äôt have to be cut short. The responsibility to address this crisis can no longer be postponed. -- -- 1 CEO and Founder of Nudge Health Visit us atwww.mynudgehealth.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams'}\n",

      "{'Title': 'Self Discipline. How to quit addictions, diet, etc. | by Edburyr | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Edburyr Follow -- Listen Share How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

We‚Äôre not talking about simple tasks anymore; AI is getting morepersonal, morecreative, and even a littleemotional(yes, AI has feelings now, sort of). So buckle up, because this post is about to dive into the quirkiest, most game-changing AI trends of 2025. Let‚Äôs break it down and have some fun while we‚Äôre at it. Okay, picture this: you‚Äôre having a rough day, and your phone ‚Äî without any drama ‚Äî sends you a text that says, ‚ÄúHey, I got your back.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs not your BFF; it‚Äôs Emotional AI. Yes, AI is finally gettingin touchwith its feelings! Emotional AI? It‚Äôs like your AI bestie who knows when you need a pep talk, or maybe just a virtual hug. Generative AI was cool before, but now? Oh boy. AI 2.0 is thecreative geniuswe never knew we needed. This isn‚Äôt just about generating text; we‚Äôre talking full-on art, stories, and even movies ‚Äî no human needed. www.sequoiacap.com Generative AI is no longer the assistant; it‚Äôs thestar of the show. Just wait until you see what it can come up with next. Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî businesses love efficiency. And what‚Äôs more efficient than AI doing all the boring stuff so you can focus onbig ideas? Businesses are waking up to the power of AI, and it‚Äôstotallyreshaping the way things get done. Efficiency is the name of the game, and AI is the MVP. Hold on. While AI is doing some pretty mind-blowing things, we need to keep it in check. Ethical AI is like the parental figure saying, ‚ÄúOkay, but only if you follow the rules.‚Äù And it‚Äôs about time. Ethical AI is the safety net that ensures we use this powerful tool for good, not for‚Ä¶ you know, world domination. (But wearekeeping an eye on that).

      "{'Title': 'The Los Angeles Fires: The Indictment of the Fossil Fuel Industry | by Ken McMullen | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ken McMullen Follow -- Listen Share ON JANUARY 21, 2025 BY PHOTOMOTOMAN IN POLITICAL EDITORIAL Share This! I am a retired Fire Chief, and former educator. For the last 30 years of my 43 year career in the fire service, I attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. It started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. That was 32 years ago. It became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. And throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, CEO‚Äôs, CAO‚Äôs, CFO‚Äôs, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. All ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. For me, my experience first began in earnest in 1989, when fires ravaged northern Manitoba, my province. I was contracted to the Provincial Government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. In my time off from being a full-time firefighter, I trained as SARTEC, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which I acquired privately by training outside the country. I also travelled throughout the North under contract. That year, fires forced the evacuation of 25,000 people across 25 communities. However in 2003, I resigned from my fire department in order to take a Fire Chief‚Äôs position in another Province. I had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in British Columbia where I had been, technically hired. That year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was 54 million dollars. By the end of the summer, the Province of British Columbia had spent 554 million dollars fighting those fires. In the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as I had already resigned my position, I took a position as the Fire Chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in Ontario, Canada in the Region of Niagara. After eight years, I found myself successfully hired as the Fire Chief for a jurisdiction in Alberta, Canada, that surrounded Calgary, Alberta. Within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Provincial Park. The fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. My attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for 150 years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. It is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over 9,000 wells drilled in 2010. I often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? I will never know, but based on what is occurring in Canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. They divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. As my contract ended, and I began a job consulting, in May 2011, a forest fire surrounding Slave Lake, Alberta, home to 7000 people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. The loss amounted to 700 million dollars. Five years later, in May 2016, Fort McMurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of 2,400 structures. The loss amounted to 3.7 billion dollars, just in insured losses. A 2017 study from MacEwan University estimated total losses were in the range of $9 billion dollars. In 2023, Canada‚Äôs most destructive year to date, there were more than 6,000 fires, and 29 mega fires, that burned 41 million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in Canada. Experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. And then this year, Jasper, Alberta, one of the jewels of Canada‚Äôs National Parks saw a fire burn 1,113 structures. None of these occurrences is normal. None of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. They are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, in Lytton, BC, another Canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. The temperatures for the last three years having exceeded 41 C. At some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in Canada in 2021 of 49.2 C or 121 F. This is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. What Does All This Have To Do With Los Angeles? This week Audie Cornish of CNN did a podcast. Her guest was Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist for NASA. His former home, which was destroyed in the Los Angeles community of Altadena, was one of the more than 12,000 homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. Peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, ‚ÄúAs a Climate Scientist, I knew it was time to leave Los Angeles,‚Äù on January 10th, in the New York Times. His personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire 14 years he had lived in Altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to Durham, North Carolina. He did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in Southern California and Nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. And this last week, he was proved right. What is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on Fox and to the incoming President of the United States, a man who hasn‚Äôt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. The problem according to Kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. Less than half of America elected the current President of the United States (49.9%), yet this ‚Äòmandate‚Äô enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. They are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. So, Where is Safe? One of Kalmus‚Äô beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. Not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, 50 years ago, is daunting. Much of what is to come, is baked into our future. Of that, there is certainty. And whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the question remains. Where is safe? Kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. Climate change is global. Obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the United States and Canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. But Ashland, North Carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. So was Lytton, British Columbia. We are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. It will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. And because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. And none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- My name is Ken McMullen. I‚Äôm a retired Director of Emergency Services and former academic.

Eileen Chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. When they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but there‚Äôs no one they can depend on. Actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. Men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. But that‚Äôs not how it is for women. They carry so much more on their shoulders. They can pick up the weight, but they can‚Äôt put it down. It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work.

By Terri Rimmer | by Terri Persico Rimmer | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': \"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Terri Persico Rimmer Follow -- Listen Share The Heart That Matters By Terri Rimmer Shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment Melody‚Äôs neighbor Samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. Fantastic! She thought. The establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. ‚ÄúYou can just give them $5, and they‚Äôll accept that, if you have it,‚Äù Samantha, who used a wheelchair, told Melody. In a few days they went to lunch there with Samantha‚Äôs granddaughter and Melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. She would be back definitely. Over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay ‚Äî or not. She found out though that they did not want her five dollars. They wanted more and made that clear. Two years prior, Melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldn‚Äôt afford to get another vehicle. Because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. She was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. A friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment Melody couldn‚Äôt do the work. Now she‚Äôd been out of a job for four years, the longest she‚Äôd ever been unemployed. Melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldn‚Äôt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. The other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but Melody‚Äôs injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. The third time Melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something Samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. She found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didn‚Äôt mind, except for this group‚Äôs attitude of entitlement. Melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. She was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. But a professional writer/former pet and house sitter also with 40 years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. Melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. And some would ask her for money which she found laughable. The owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didn‚Äôt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. He gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. This was not the person she was. Now it was Christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough she‚Äôd had over a year that she‚Äôd been on over 19 medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. The allergist had given her the answer she‚Äôd been seeking since last year regarding her condition ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt contagious, it wasn‚Äôt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. Whew! She was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. Others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed Melody. The manager took her name, and she didn‚Äôt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. She couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. No sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. ‚ÄúHi, friend,‚Äù he said insincerely. ‚ÄúYou seem like you don‚Äôt feel well.‚Äù Melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didn‚Äôt believe her. ‚ÄúWell, if you can‚Äôt get that coughing under control you can‚Äôt eat today,‚Äù he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. She thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. The woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. The manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. So, once he walked away Melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldn‚Äôt see it. ‚ÄúI know how it is,‚Äù Melody told the woman. ‚ÄúI was in a group home before.‚Äù So, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. Now Melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. As she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. ‚ÄúHonestly, it doesn‚Äôt get any better than the mission here!‚Äù spouted a customer. -- -- I have 41 years of journalism experience having written for ten newspapers, some magazines, and web sites.

Still going strong on the no-alcohol front. Stilltryingto go strong on the running front. I‚Äôm not really craving alcohol anymore, and I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm currently elliptical and can‚Äôt properly run for the time-being. My last run was a treadmill run. My knees and my hip started hurting immediately. But my stubborn ass said, ‚ÄúHaha, no‚Äù and I put on another episode of my zombie thing and kept running. Despite the pain, I can confirm that run #6 sucked quite a bit less than run #1. I was able to do my signature slow-jog for about 15 minutes before I stopped, and I only stopped because I needed water. I even started to zone out a little, and think about other things. But now, in addition to fucking up my hip, I also have pretty constant pain my knees. Since those things are all pretty important, I took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). I know PT is something I need to do because I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. However I would MUCH rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. Ugh. Or RUNNING SHOES. But I‚Äôm making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. Anyway, I now have a PT plan to help with the pain. And even though Iknowit will help me feel better, I will certainly not be excited about doing it. I‚Äôm also an instant gratification human, which is another reason that long-term projects are hard for me. I find myself rushing through writing and rushing through art projects just because I want them to bedone.I try to take shortcuts. I don‚Äôt take the time totrulycrease the origami paper, so my cranes always look wonky. I haven‚Äôt felt very inspired on the writing front lately.

      "{'Title': 'Why perfectionism is a hindrance? | by Maryam | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Maryam Follow -- Listen Share Are you also a perfectionist like me? I always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. Under too much pressure to be perfect, I was always an average student because instead of working hard, I kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. This all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. üòî I knew I had to make a change. It wasn‚Äôt an easy process, but I actively decided to find the solution. So, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that I can decide when to stop chasing for it. Learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. In this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve his/her full potential. It‚Äôs the obsession that creates the problem. We just have to know the limits! Do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know it‚Äôs probably unattainable? Why do we do this? Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit. Essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. It encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. From an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently ‚Äòperfect lives\\' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. The flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. This constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. Nobody likes failing, right? Sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. We always think like, ‚ÄúIf I aim high enough, I‚Äôll minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing‚Äù. This fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. üçÇ The problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. Impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. Furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. Excess of anything is harmful. Our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. We are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. These images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. The pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. Many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. By meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. They may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. The ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. But sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. Also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. For some\\xa0of\\xa0us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. We believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. It‚Äôs a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though it‚Äôs often based on flawed assumptions. Many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; it‚Äôs about earning approval and acceptance. -Brene Brown The pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. When we‚Äôre so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. We might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. Ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. Continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. Celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. As Alexander Pope aptly said, ‚Äúto err is human, to forgive divine‚Äù Embrace imperfection and recognize that it‚Äôs a natural part of the human experience. It also helps to reframe our definition of success. Instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. Did we learn something new? Did we overcome a challenge? Those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasn‚Äôt \"perfect.\" Ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. By embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives.

      "{'Title': 'The Silent Enemy: Why Cancer Is Smarter Than You Think | by Saad Elbekri, MD | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Saad Elbekri, MD Follow -- Listen Share Imagine you\\'re sitting in a doctor\\'s office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: \"You have cancer.\" It\\'s shocking. Every day, 60,000 people face this same unexpected reality. Most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: \"I felt perfectly healthy.\" They didn\\'t realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. I have some terrible news: You have a1 in 5 chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. But wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. But here\\'s the catch: It\\'s far more complicated than it seems. Even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting I\\'ve performed. And despite all our training and research ‚Äî doctors still don\\'t fully understand cancer. Cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. Cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. Cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body\\'s defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine\\'s biggest challenges. At its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. Depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. The real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don\\'t follow the rules. Usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body\\'s police force ‚Äî your immune system ‚Äî and removed. Even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: Now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body\\'s defences. This buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. Initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. As the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. When the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. My colleagues and I can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. Still, that\\'s precisely for situations I\\'m getting paid for, and I like it. But here\\'s where it gets tricky: Cancer cells have a unique ability ‚Äî they can take highways through your body to spread. This process is calledmetastasis. There are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: At this point, treatment becomes more complicated. Surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. Usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. Metastasis no longer means the end ‚Äî it just means the treatment needs more personalization. But the big question remains. Damage occurs when the cell\\'s DNA is altered. Cell DNA acts as the user manual for how your cell works. When that manual is damaged, the cell develops DNA mutations, which cause it to malfunction. There are two ways a cell can get damaged: Purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. It\\'s like receiving an altered manual the moment you\\'re born. Cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of DNA damage. Sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. Cancers show up much later. Bad habits usually cause this type of DNA mutation. For example (to name a few): Those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell\\'s DNA, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. Usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. But cancer cells are smarter than you think. The more damage a cell accumulates, the more its DNA gets altered. Cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. Remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. It can now: It\\'s like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. And here is how they do it. Cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body\\'s defences: Yes. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. But there\\'s an even better approach: The best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. Early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. Cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. Your health is worth it.

Every system, every environment, and everything around us requires change after a certain time.

I do not like to entertain an impulse-driven environment because then you just become an enabler, a consumer to the chaos ‚Äî noise. A lot has been happening around us, as always.

Recently, Trump announced a major boost for AI infrastructure in the United States, with private companies planning to invest up to $500 billion over the next four years. A new venture, calledStargate, is being launched by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, according to sources familiar with the deal. Leaders from these companies, including SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman, and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, are expected to join Trump at the White House to make the announcement. The partnership will begin with a $100 billion investment and start its first project ‚Äî a data center in Texas. The plan is to expand to other states over time. Other investors are expected to join, though their identities have not yet been revealed. Stargate aims to create cutting-edge infrastructure to support AI development in the U.S. While spokespeople for SoftBank and OpenAI have not commented, this massive initiative signals a strong push to position the U.S. as a leader in AI technology.

In the late 19th century, international efforts to combat diseases like cholera and yellow fever laid the groundwork for cooperation across borders. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the aftermath of World War II that global leaders recognized the need for a central organization to address health issues on a worldwide scale. TheWHOwas officially established on April 7, 1948, a date now celebrated annually as World Health Day. With 61 countries signing its constitution, the WHO marked the beginning of a unified approach to tackling global health challenges. The WHO‚Äôs vision is ambitious yet simple: ‚ÄúHealth for All.‚Äù This encapsulates its mission to ensure that all people have access to essential healthcare services without suffering financial hardship. Its objectives include: The WHO emphasizes collaboration, working with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders to achieve its goals. TheWorld Health Organization‚Äôs work spans a broad spectrum of activities aimed at improving global health. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key functions: The WHO develops guidelines and standards that influence health practices worldwide. For example, it publishes the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a critical tool for tracking and diagnosing diseases. The WHO plays a pivotal role in eradicating and controlling infectious diseases. Its notable successes include the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and its ongoing efforts to eliminate polio. The organization also leads campaigns against malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, providing funding, resources, and technical expertise. During health crises such as pandemics, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks, the WHO steps in to coordinate international responses. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO distributed over 1 billion doses of vaccines through the COVAX initiative, saving countless lives. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are leading causes of death globally. The WHO advocates for preventive measures, such as reducing tobacco use, encouraging physical activity, and promoting healthy diets. The WHO is committed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. Through programs like the Every Woman Every Child initiative, it ensures better access to prenatal care, safe childbirth, and nutrition for mothers and children. Recognizing mental health as an integral part of overall well-being, the WHO works to destigmatize mental illness and improve access to mental health services. Its global mental health action plan emphasizes the need for early intervention and support systems. One of the WHO‚Äôs most celebrated accomplishments is the eradication of smallpox. Through a coordinated vaccination campaign, the disease was officially declared eradicated in 1980, saving millions of lives. Although polio remains endemic in a few regions, the WHO‚Äôs Global Polio Eradication Initiative has brought the world closer to eradicating this crippling disease.

Treasuring thefirsttime seeing the result of his labor from whacking thick pods with a knife and piling the milky beans in a heap before drying later for shipment, an older guy, as he sat among workers, mostly in flip-flops and dingy shirts, held the unwrapped chocolate bar up to talk, basking in his moment of glory. Impatiently, their hands reached out until he mentioned his obligation as the eldest to taste what the stranger had given him. When he finally indulged himself, the sweetness immediately spread across his lips into a smile. Earlier, another laborer, prompted by a flashing notion, had shared what he thought with others, one of several comments the group associated with eating chocolate. ‚ÄúThis is why white people are so healthy.‚Äù Saving the wrapper in his pocket after passing the rest to others, the eldest there declared that he would take it home to show to his family, so proud of his discovery of chocolate, a delicacy forcenturiesin many parts of the world, especially oncecompaniespoured in enough milk and sugar to keep dentists and physicians in business, as patients succumbed to cavities and a litany of diseases from obesity. Count me as one of the many who enjoyed those delectable desires sweetened for addiction. Switching over gradually to the kind without any added sweetness took years before I got used to the taste. Even now, I chase that bitterness down with a banana or a pinch of raisins and constantly keep an eye on the scale, adjusting daily desires by the ounce, because I treasure good health. Otherwise, I‚Äôd eat up a few sizes from all the frigid temperatures that have kept me in this season. Jazzed bysnow, the most, from what I read online, since Valentine‚Äôs of 1895, Fat Tuesday came early for strollers in New Orleans, as unseemly weather shut down the city, while also giving mothers a reason to celebrate with their kids who, like that guy tasting chocolate first, smiled wide at the sight of soft mounds piling atop cars and layering lawns everywhere ‚Äî a memory imprinted forever in a treasured click for a photo album, adding to the joy from a day off from schoolwork. First times, as well as final ones, occupy a special place that we embrace more emotionally than whatever happened before or afterward ‚Äî whether in a tasted desire or prized memory. Memories of those first moments often last throughout life, adding layers of context for comparison as we mature and grow through the years. Once we add similar moments, that original impression slowly depreciates until it loses its luster, the charm of what made it precious in the first place. Eyes that once dazzled look elsewhere now at a dinner table. Instead of connecting deeply to refresh the feeling that we promised to hold on to forever, we slip into going through the motions of just another habit ‚Äî a hug without meaning more, just another piece of chocolate for our lips. Valentine‚Äôs Day, as well as a couple of other days throughout the year, particularly the annual sale of Leonidas Chocolate, usually brings on an urge for me to resist perhaps my favorite temptation for a delicacy. However, a frozen winter of singleness has one advantage going for it ‚Äî buying less processed chocolate to sprinkle in for a random occasion, especially with fewer bouquets of scented petals that wilt by the week. Despite missing out on delectable treats that whet my appetite each year, I manage to flavor bitter nibs daily and savor them with fruit to suit my taste. Consequently, I refresh an edible joy that keeps me coming back for more each day, though rather hard-pressed to remember that first taste of chocolate ever. If I reacted similarly to the man in the video after that first bite of chocolate, my impression faded quickly amid sweetness packaged on shelves easily within reach, perhaps in preparing me for a world filled with irresistible eye candy often painted on lips. This morning‚Äôs reading treasures wisdom that knows which desires mean more and which pleasures require greater self-discipline. Each day, we encounter a new opportunity to improve on the day before or just drift back to the pack of mediocrity ‚Äî that first nibble for a taste of what lies ahead or fresh snow for a memory in years to come.

In an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ‚Äî AI-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. Yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasn‚Äôt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. Many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. After all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary AI model is what attracts funding and headlines. But here‚Äôs the catch: digital health is not just about technology; it‚Äôs about people. Whether it‚Äôs convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. In fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô side of the business. To be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. A leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. However, technology alone can‚Äôt explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. It‚Äôs the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. Think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? Or one who can design a wearable but can‚Äôt address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? In digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. Technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but it‚Äôs time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code.

The dye was alreadybanned in 1990in cosmetics for causing cancer in lab rats who ingested it. Fast forward 35 years, to yesterday, when it is finally banned in food, when we knew all along it caused cancer ifeaten. It was also‚Äúrestricted‚Äùin the EU in 1994, with allowance in cocktail cherries, aka Maraschino cherries. Maraschino cherries ‚Äî a preserved, candied cherry,originally never used dye in the first place. Created in Europe, the spirit companyLuxardo(who claims ownership), released them in 1821, using alcohol and sugar as the preservative. Eventually the cherries made their way to the US and then prohibition happened. in the 1920s, a professor in Oregon created his own version using calcium salts and brine as a preservative, which removed the coloring, so he added back coloring, artificially, giving them their bright red color. This colorant was banned in the 60s for causing cancer, so manufacturers started using another artificial colorant ‚Äî Red 40, which also causes cancer and neurological issues in humans. Red 40 is still used today in Maraschino cherries and many other foods and drinks and cosmetics. Let‚Äôs review. I am going to make this short and sweet. Just like us, large organizations, governments, charities, corporations also want self preservation, but the want it for the ‚Äúorganizations‚Äù interest aka the shareholders/stakeholders. They may employ humans like you and me, but they employ them to work on their behalf. Why do humans comply? The paycheck they receive serves their own self-interests enough to make them do things they know are not benefiting others. Nothing will change until we demand it. Power is never given back, and rarely is money. If we want to take our power back, we need to take power away from entities who are not protecting us.

      "{'Title': 'Healing Humanity or Modern Eugenics? CRISPR Determines the Future of Human Evolution | by Shaelin Gorny | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shaelin Gorny Follow -- Listen Share Imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. A world where individuals don‚Äôt spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like Huntington‚Äôs disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. A world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. This is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. But alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. A dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where CRISPR places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. While genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. In 2018,Chinese scientist He Jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to HIV, resulting in the birth of twin girls(Raposo). Globally,42.3 million people have died from HIV, yet with CRISPR, no more have to (‚ÄúHIV‚Äù). While this trial showcased gene editing‚Äôs revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.The experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(‚ÄúWhat are the Ethical Concerns‚Ä¶?‚Äù). A clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. But what happens when scientific experimentation isn‚Äôt strictly monitored? In the cases of theTuskegee Syphilis Study,Henrietta Lacks,Nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: Catastrophe. This same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of Nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. What happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? Prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them ‚Äî a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. Evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.A 2018 study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens‚Äô adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(Agha et al.). Narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. However, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. This technology could end generations of suffering.Genome mutations cause roughly 7,000 known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (‚ÄúUsing gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases‚Äù). CRISPR technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as Huntington‚Äôs disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable ‚Äîcurrent treatment costs of $2.2 million reflect the high expense of novel technologies‚Äî it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (Pagliarulo and Lucas). Unfortunately, humans won‚Äôt stop at disease eradication. If we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldn‚Äôt we? Enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. Targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. Take theCCR5-Œî32 mutation, which Chinese scientist He Jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(Sanders). This mutation prohibits HIV infection, yetincreases susceptibility to West Nile virus and leads to a 21% higher overall mortality rate(Sanders). This is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. Eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. Additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(‚ÄúAccelerating Global Access to Gene Therapies‚Äù). While disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. Enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. What may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. Such pursuits are simply indefensible. What is the true cost of progress? When ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? Well, let‚Äôs review a familiar example. What did He Jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? Prison. Reckless application of CRISPR technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. But on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? If genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist ‚Äî it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.The World Health Organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(‚ÄúHealth Ethics & Governance‚Äù). Without enforcement, these measures are futile. CRISPR holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. But if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. This isn‚Äôt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. As a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing? The choice ‚Äî and the responsibility ‚Äî belongs to all of us.

      "{'Title': \"The Silent Epidemic. Understanding Cardiodiabesity's Threat‚Ä¶ | by Luis Cisneros | Jan, 2025 | Medium\", 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Luis Cisneros Follow -- 1 Listen Share In discussions about America‚Äôs most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. Yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. This complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. It‚Äôs a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Research by Evernorth reveals a startling statistic: 93% of adults in the United States suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. This figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. The rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. Between 1999 and 2020, adult obesity rates soared from 30.5% to 41.9%. If current trends persist, half of all American adults could be classified as obese by 2030. But this is far from a superficial issue ‚Äì it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of $719 billion annually. To put this into perspective, consider Sarah, a 45-year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. Her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. Over time, she developed type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. Sarah‚Äôs story mirrors that of millions of Americans. Collectively, the costs associated with obesity ($173 billion), heart disease and stroke ($219 billion), and diabetes ($327 billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. These expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity ‚Äì making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. While individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. Social and economic factors account for 40% of health outcomes, according to public health data. These include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability ‚Äì all of which shape an individual‚Äôs ability to maintain good health. The physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (10%), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for 20% and 30%, respectively. This breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. ‚ÄúIt is better to prevent than to cure. ‚Äì Ibn Sina‚Äù The encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable ‚Äì and, in many cases, reversible. Early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. A variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. Take, for instance, the initiative led by Cigna Healthcare in partnership with Virgin Pulse. By allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. Statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. Families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. The impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. Addressing cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a moral imperative ‚Äì it‚Äôs an economic one. Companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. On a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. Much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. Healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. Integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. The stakes are enormous. Cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a set of disconnected health problems ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of American life, from families to workplaces to entire communities. This is not a challenge we can address piecemeal or delay for another generation. If we fail to act, millions will continue to face shortened lives, mounting medical bills, and preventable suffering. We‚Äôve seen what coordinated action can do in the face of major health threats like cancer or heart disease. It‚Äôs time to bring that same urgency and focus to cardiodiabesity. The longer we wait, the more lives and resources we lose to a crisis that we already know how to address. This isn‚Äôt just about statistics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about people, families, and futures that don‚Äôt have to be cut short. The responsibility to address this crisis can no longer be postponed. -- -- 1 CEO and Founder of Nudge Health Visit us atwww.mynudgehealth.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams'}\n",

Those are the people who I see as an addiction nurse. People who suffer from trauma, and pain, got into the notion of covering the pain by drinking alcohol to numb the painful memories. I had seen people become addicted to alcohol as a child as they were given regular drinks by parents, aunts, abusers, and more. A devastating cycle.

      "{'Title': 'Why Parents Should Include Their Children In Organized Sports | by Emory Menefee | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emory Menefee Follow -- Listen Share Why Parents Should Include Their Children In Organized Sports It‚Äôs important that parents put their kids in organized sports while growing up as it has many benefits such as maintaining strong health, heightened concentration in school, as well as psychological and social benefits as they progress into adulthood. I can vouch that sports have shaped the person I am today and helped me overcome the obstacles I encountered while growing up. When my parents separated and went through the divorce process, sports were a pivotal outlet for me. It was an area of freedom and fun away from my outside life. As a young adult who has suffered from anxiety and depression since I was thirteen due to the things happening with my family, I can say without a doubt that sports saved me. Many of my fondest memories and accomplishments came from being in sports, like scoring the game winning goal with thirty-one seconds left my junior year to be crowned the league champions with my soccer team. I don‚Äôt get the best moment of my life without organized sports. For starters, physical activity helps maintain strong health. Exercising is one of the best ways to keep children in shape and to help prevent diseases and illnesses. (National Institutes of Health, 2016). Studies showed that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of injuries, different types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer, as well as reducing risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure. The American Journal of Preventive Medicine said after school physical programs have reduced obesity the most. Having your kids stay active would help reduce lower medical care as they would be healthier more often which also results in less financial burdens. As mothers and fathers, one of your main goals in life is to always keep your kids safe, and having kids in organized sports keeps your kids healthy which helps towards that goal. Kids participating in organized sports growing up have shown to translate into benefits in the learning environment. A study that followed children from kindergarten to fourth grade showed that physical activities help children to develop and improve their cognitive skills. It has been associated with children getting better grades and doing better on standardized tests. Physical activity has also been shown to improve attitudes and academic behavior including ‚Äúenhanced concentration and attention‚Äù (GAO, 2012). Sports have always motivated me to have higher concentration in my academics to make sure I maintained solid grades. My parents would not allow me to participate in my sports if my grades weren‚Äôt good. That extra incentive while growing up helped me especially in middle school to stay focused and committed to getting good grades. Those good grades alongside sports helped me get admitted into a selective prep high school. Studies on the high school age group showed that teenagers who participated in sports are more likely to attend college and get degrees than non-athletes. Studies have shown that sports can have beneficial effects on individuals even into their adulthoods, which explained that the benefits extend into the workplace. A survey of 400 female corporate executives found that 94% played a sport growing up and 61% said it beneficially impacted their career success. (EY Women Athletes Business Network/espnW, 2014). Additionally, physical activity has also been proven to have a positive impact on mental health and social skills. Kids who are involved in physical activity have reported to have more excitement, more happiness and motivation in their day to day lives, whereas kids who are inactive reported greater nervousness, anxiety, depression, and worry. Physical activity has been shown to boost self-esteem, leadership, and goal-setting skills. A 2019 study found that children who reported to have no physical activity in their life were twice as likely to have mental health issues. According to the United Nations, sports have been proven to provide a safe environment and community for many participants. They may be having trouble at school or having issues at home. Organized sports have helped kids find an outlet from their everyday lives. It helps unite these kids to learn how to work together in a manner that also teaches them to learn the value of teamwork and respect. Additionally, it helps teach children at a young age to develop a passion for something. I fell in love with soccer and basketball when I was three. I developed many of the friendships and relationships I hold dear to this day. The community I fostered at a young age never faltered. I still reach out to old coaches I have had in the past for advice and guidance. I still keep in touch with old teammates and all of us wish each other success and happiness whenever we see one another accomplishing the goals we set when we were younger. I acknowledge that organized sports as the years progress the cost to participate also increases. There‚Äôs a fee for equipment, travel cost, hotel and food. My parents paid for me to play club soccer from age ten to eighteen. Countless practices and games. Many tournaments required us to travel to different states. Different jerseys, shorts, and socks each and every year. I agree that it can add up. When I spoke to my parents, I had asked them if they regretted any of it and they said no. They were just proud of where their daughter is today.

      "{'Title': '‚ÄúWhen Rest Feels Like a Distant Dream‚Äù | by Steven Clario | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Steven Clario Follow -- Listen Share There‚Äôs a weight that settles deep within you, one that no amount of sleep seems to lift. You try to rest, to let go, but the moment you close your eyes, the thoughts come rushing in.Did I do enough today? Did I say the right thing? What about tomorrow?It‚Äôs like trying to swim in quicksand ‚Äî the harder you fight, the deeper you sink. Rest isn‚Äôt just lying down; it‚Äôs surrendering, and for some of us, surrender feels dangerous. The silence of stillness can be deafening, amplifying all the doubts and fears we‚Äôve spent the day trying to drown out. We tell ourselves we‚Äôll rest later, after we‚Äôve done more, fixed more, achieved more. But later never comes, and the exhaustion grows, until even the idea of rest feels impossible. Somewhere along the way, we learned to equate rest with laziness, with failure.If you stop, you‚Äôll fall behind.If you rest, you‚Äôre weak.These lies become our truth, and we wear our exhaustion like a badge of honor, proof that we‚Äôre working hard, trying hard, living hard. But deep down, we know the truth: we‚Äôre breaking. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôve convinced yourself that your worth is tied to how much you do, how much you give, how much you endure. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôre afraid of what might surface in the quiet ‚Äî the fears you‚Äôve buried, the grief you‚Äôve ignored, the parts of yourself you‚Äôve been too scared to face. Just like your heart needs a beat of silence between every pulse, you need moments to pause, to breathe, to simply exist without expectation. Rest isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness; it‚Äôs an act of courage. It‚Äôs saying,I choose to care for myself, even when the world tells me I shouldn‚Äôt. And yes, it‚Äôs terrifying. Slowing down feels like losing control. But control is an illusion anyway. The world will keep spinning whether you‚Äôre running yourself into the ground or taking a moment to recover. The difference is, when you choose rest, you give yourself a chance to heal, to rebuild, to carry on without breaking completely. So, if you feel like you can‚Äôt stop ‚Äî stop anyway. Not forever, not all at once, but for a moment. Let the world wait. Let the guilt scream and the doubts whisper. Sit with them. Breathe through them. And remind yourself of this truth:you are not your productivity. Your value isn‚Äôt measured by how much you give to others but by the fact that you are here, alive, trying. Even if rest feels impossible now, it‚Äôs not. Start small ‚Äî a breath, a pause, a moment of stillness. You deserve to be whole, not just what‚Äôs left after everyone else has taken their share. You deserve peace, even when the world doesn‚Äôt offer it freely. And most of all, you deserve rest ‚Äî because you‚Äôve carried enough for today. -- -- Navigating mental health, and something about growth.

Karty | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in M. E. Karty Follow -- Listen Share Below is an unanswered, unacknowledged email I sent about my foodborne botulism case to a journalist in Indianapolis, Indiana . I almost died of food poisoning, was paralyzed and on a ventilator of two months, and it doesn‚Äôt make the paper? No news outlets? Not even a blogpost? Are you kidding me? I am just now healthy enough to write about it. I am not going to shut up about it, because food safety will only get worse under this next administration. Until I am dead, I will not be silenced. Hello Ms. Xxxxxx, I received your information from Xssss Xssssssss, a colleague of yours. He thought you would be the person to direct this story. On August 5th, 2024, my husband and I contracted foodborne botulism. After a night of violent vomiting and other gastrointestinal distress, things turned worse. Within hours, I lost the use of my legs and had shortness of breath. My husband was vomiting as well and had double vision and we were both slurring our words. Something deathly was wrong. We called my brother-in-law, a hospitalist MD out of Xxxxxxx, and he said to go to the emergency room immediately. My father-in-law from Xxxxxxx happened to be in the area visiting his sister and took my husband to Community North. We called an ambulance for me because I couldn‚Äôt move and was gasping for air. We believe we were diagnosed with botulism in a timely manner because we went in together. By all looks of things, my husband, a fifty-year-old, looked like he was having a stroke. What we conjecture is that his symptoms along with my descending paralysis from the head down was how they caught it. By then, the paralysis had reached my diaphragm and I could no longer breathe on my own. By the Grace of God and excellent medical care, a doctor recognized our combined symptoms as botulism. There is a test for botulism, and that takes four days. I think without intervention, I would have been dead within hours. The doctor called the CDC and an anti-toxin was flown in from Chicago. The anti-toxin was administered, and we lived. My husband left the hospital, walking with a cane breathing on his own, in three weeks. My exposure must have been more extreme because I was a lot sicker. After two days of struggling to breath, I was intubated after what can only be categorized as a near death experience. I later had a tracheostomy and breathed through a tube in my neck for eight weeks. It took me a full twelve weeks to recover from the paralysis to walk and talk again. It has been five months, and I still have to walk with a walker. That is one heck of a story, right? So why is our case on the CDC or Indiana Health Department‚Äôs website? I called the Indiana Health Department and they said there has to be at least ten cases in order for it to be worthy of public record. Two cases of botulism are two cases too many. I understand because of HIPPA, that my anonymity is paramount, but so is public health. I am willing to out myself to bring attention to this deadly, but treatable disease. Yes, botulism is rare and only deadly in five percent of cases, if it is caught in time. Many of my doctors and nurses said they haven‚Äôt seen a botulism case in twenty years. That doesn‚Äôt mean that there were unreported botulism because it was not diagnosed in time. Undiagnosed botulism looks like heart failure or unexplained pnemonia. I was lucky and healthy enough to recover. I was lucky to have insurance and to live in Indianapolis with access to top notch health centers like Community North and Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana (RHI). I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to have the forty pounds to lose in two months. I had no underlying conditions. You change one factor, and I‚Äôm dead of suffocation or heart failure in the first twenty-four hours, or I‚Äôm dead of pneumonia in two weeks. I am a miracle of luck and medical science, and no one outside of my inner circle knows about it. I want everyone to know about it. Our food supply chain is already shaky because of monopolies, and I fear with the incoming administration and the overturning of the Chevron decision that essentially weakened Federal agencies, such as the FDA, things will get worse. If my ordeal can make a difference, I am willing to forgo my anonymity for healthcare providers, legislators, and the public to know how to protect themselves when dinner turns deadly. I am looking forward to speaking with you. Sincerely, M*** K***** Botulism Survivor -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Sit-to-Stand Desks: a Small Change for a Big Impact | by Margaret Fennebresque | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Margaret Fennebresque Follow -- Listen Share With around ‚Öì of the child population overweight or obese and 40% unable to read at a basic level, I think we can all agree that good health and academic optimization are two things America needs more of (Fiorenzi;Literacy Statistics 2022‚Äì2023). What if I were to tell you that there is a simple action that American schools can take that addresses both health complications and academic hardships? Well, I hope you‚Äôre on the edge of your seat because I want you to get out of it. That‚Äôs right‚Äì stand up, as my research has led me to believe that the solution is standing! American schools should transition to sit-to-stand desks to take advantage of the plethora of benefits to standing instead of sitting, ranging from hindering health issues like diabetes and ADHD to cultivating academic success by improving mood and averting hours of unproductivity. Tens of thousands of hours of every American‚Äôs life is spent at school, and 65‚Äì70% of this time is spent sitting down (Leech;Prepwise).Sitting is the new smoking, you might have heard, and this claim is backed by findings linking health complications such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease to sedentary time (Fiorenzi). Fortunately, standing desks, being on the path to movement, aids in combating each of such complications. Standing burns more calories than sitting, averaging an additional 50 calories per hour in adults, and studies have shown that obese or overweight children burn even more than their healthy-weight peers (Fiorenzi). Standing has been found to reduce blood sugar spikes after meals, a benefit especially helpful for diabetics but good for everyone since ‚Äúgreater amplitudes of glycemic variability have been linked to circulatory oxidative stress‚Äù (Jubbal). Standing is also connected with better heart health, as a study consisting of sitting and standing bus drivers observed that the standing drivers‚Äô risk for heart disease was half of that of the sitting drivers (Leech). If standing were to become the social norm, both the physiological perks and a new social pressure to be healthy enough to stand for longer periods would hinder health complications in the American school population. Consistent with the correlation between better health and academic achievement, sit-to-stand desks provide users with a better learning experience by optimizing key factors to academic success, including productivity, mood, and attention (Kurniawan;Schmidt;Valiente). One of the more obvious perks of a standing desk is postural improvement; good posture naturally reduces back, neck and sciatica pain (Leech). According to astudy, patients suffering from chronic pain had an average reduction of 9.8 hours of work productivity per week. I‚Äôm not sure about you, but I can learn quite a lot in almost 10 hours. A lesser known perk of a standing desk is its effect on mood: a positive one to be more specific. In one study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue and 87% reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day and after returning to sitting desks their moods reverted to their original levels (Leech). This study complements other research finding sitting and sedentary lifestyles linked with increased risks of depression and anxiety (Leech). As a student, I can attest that maintaining a positive outlook has pushed me to take risks that have led to my own academic success. Although you might have expected that standing desks would create distraction for children, I have found far more evidence suggesting just the opposite. I acknowledge that there is some anecdotal evidence documenting young children bumping into one another while using standing desks, however, recall that chairs create similar distractions including rocking, footsie, and leg swinging (‚ÄúThe Effects of Standing Desks‚Äù). On the other hand, one study demonstrated that students using standing desks exhibited ‚Äúsignificant improvements in attention and inhibitory control compared to their sitting peers,‚Äù and schoolchildren in the experiment group of another study that used standing-desks were found to be between 12 and 25% more engaged than the control group (Fiorenzi;Otto). Dr. Mark Benden of Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health explains this finding well: ‚ÄúWhen kids sit at a desk all day, they don‚Äôt have to use any energy, which means they can just as easily fall asleep, daydream, or distract themselves by distracting others‚Äù (Fiorenzi). At least for me, it ismuchharder to fall asleep standing up. Considering that standing expends more energy than sitting, it‚Äôs logical that distraction would be reduced, a boon particularly for millions of American children diagnosed with ADD or ADHD (Fiorenzi). Hopefully at this point, you‚Äôre convinced that standing desks have immense benefits. You may still be wondering, though, is it worth the effort to replace all sitting desks with standing desks? Allow me to clarify what I mean by ‚Äútransitioning to sit-to-stand desks.‚Äù It‚Äôd be a waste to toss out perfectly adequate sitting desks already owned, but I do think that when schools are in the market for new desks, they should purchase sit-to-stand desks. Sit-to-stand desks allow users to adjust the height of the desk, giving them the option to sit or stand, thereby taking into consideration the needs of physically disabled children and providing flexibility for various activities. Lastly, whereas the monetary price of sit-to-stand desks might be slightly more than that of a sitting-only desk, having the ability to make use of the numerous, substantial advantages of standing sure seem to outweigh that small cost differential. If you believe in having a healthy, educated population, I urge you to use your influence as a student, parent, teacher, staff member, administrator, or alumni to advocate for sit-to-stand desks in your school.

But researchers aren‚Äôt just focused on adding years ‚Äî they‚Äôre looking to extend health alongside lifespan. A recent study offers a glimpse into what may be possible: combining two FDA-approved drugs,trametinibandrapamycin, resulted in a significant lifespan increase in mice, while also improving their health in old age. Researchers gave one group of mice trametinib, another group rapamycin, and a third group a combination of the two. The results were striking: ‚Ä¢Trametinib aloneextended median lifespan by7%‚Äì10%, depending on sex. ‚Ä¢Rapamycin aloneincreased lifespan by17%‚Äì18%. ‚Ä¢ Thecombination of both drugsshowed the most dramatic effects, boosting lifespan by35% in femalesand27% in males. What‚Äôs more, the maximum lifespan (the longest any mice lived) increased significantly when both drugs were used together, highlighting their additive benefits. Both drugs target different cellular pathways involved in aging: ‚Ä¢Trametinibworks on a pathway that regulates cell growth. ‚Ä¢Rapamycininhibits a pathway linked to inflammation and age-related diseases. By combining these mechanisms, the drugs created a stronger anti-aging effect than either could achieve alone. Extending lifespan is one thing, but how did the micefeelas they aged? Researchers found the drug combo also improved key markers of health: ‚Ä¢Heart health:Delayed age-related decline in heart function. ‚Ä¢Tumors:Reduced tumor growth and overall tumor load. ‚Ä¢Inflammation:Lowered inflammation in the brain and body. However, it wasn‚Äôt all good news. Some mice experienced side effects like fatty liver disease and testicular degeneration, raising questions about how these drugs might work in humans. Both trametinib and rapamycin are FDA-approved, but for very different uses: ‚Ä¢Trametinibtreats certain types of cancer. ‚Ä¢Rapamycinis used after organ transplants to prevent rejection. The fact that these drugs are already approved opens the door for further research into their potential as longevity treatments. However, what works in mice doesn‚Äôt always translate to humans. Animal studies like this are an exciting starting point, but testing in humans could take decades. Scientists are now exploring whether combining even more drugs ‚Äî like diabetes medications metformin and acarbose ‚Äî could create an even stronger anti-aging effect. The goal is to target multiple cellular pathways to not only extend lifespan but also reduce age-related diseases. But before you get too excited, remember: it‚Äôs still early days. While these findings are promising, the path from lab to human trials is long and full of challenges. This study highlights the potential of drug combinations to unlock new frontiers in longevity research. While human applications are still far off, these findings show that targeting multiple aging pathways could be the key to living not just longer, but healthier lives.

Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

You know how we‚Äôve all been talking about robots, self-driving cars, and the AI takeover? Well, 2025 has officially arrived, and AI isn‚Äôt just a buzzword anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs running the show. We‚Äôre not talking about simple tasks anymore; AI is getting morepersonal, morecreative, and even a littleemotional(yes, AI has feelings now, sort of). So buckle up, because this post is about to dive into the quirkiest, most game-changing AI trends of 2025. Let‚Äôs break it down and have some fun while we‚Äôre at it. Okay, picture this: you‚Äôre having a rough day, and your phone ‚Äî without any drama ‚Äî sends you a text that says, ‚ÄúHey, I got your back.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs not your BFF; it‚Äôs Emotional AI. Yes, AI is finally gettingin touchwith its feelings! Emotional AI? It‚Äôs like your AI bestie who knows when you need a pep talk, or maybe just a virtual hug. Generative AI was cool before, but now? Oh boy. AI 2.0 is thecreative geniuswe never knew we needed. This isn‚Äôt just about generating text; we‚Äôre talking full-on art, stories, and even movies ‚Äî no human needed. www.sequoiacap.com Generative AI is no longer the assistant; it‚Äôs thestar of the show. Just wait until you see what it can come up with next. Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî businesses love efficiency. And what‚Äôs more efficient than AI doing all the boring stuff so you can focus onbig ideas? Businesses are waking up to the power of AI, and it‚Äôstotallyreshaping the way things get done. Efficiency is the name of the game, and AI is the MVP. Hold on. While AI is doing some pretty mind-blowing things, we need to keep it in check. Ethical AI is like the parental figure saying, ‚ÄúOkay, but only if you follow the rules.‚Äù And it‚Äôs about time. Ethical AI is the safety net that ensures we use this powerful tool for good, not for‚Ä¶ you know, world domination. (But wearekeeping an eye on that). Wait, did you say AI is helping save the planet? Yep, you heard that right. It‚Äôs not all about robots taking over the world; AI is actually doing its part to keep the Earth from going full-on disaster movie. www.weforum.org AI is like the eco-warrior of the future. But instead of capes, it‚Äôs all about algorithms and sensors. Go, team AI! Alright, so you‚Äôre probably wondering, ‚ÄúHow do I stay ahead of all this tech stuff?‚Äù Simple ‚Äî stay curious, keep learning, and maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî don‚Äôt get on the bad side of AI. We‚Äôre talking about upskilling in AI-related fields, embracing innovation, and using AI as your partner in crime.

      "{'Title': 'The Los Angeles Fires: The Indictment of the Fossil Fuel Industry | by Ken McMullen | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ken McMullen Follow -- Listen Share ON JANUARY 21, 2025 BY PHOTOMOTOMAN IN POLITICAL EDITORIAL Share This! I am a retired Fire Chief, and former educator. For the last 30 years of my 43 year career in the fire service, I attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. It started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. That was 32 years ago. It became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. And throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, CEO‚Äôs, CAO‚Äôs, CFO‚Äôs, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. All ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. For me, my experience first began in earnest in 1989, when fires ravaged northern Manitoba, my province. I was contracted to the Provincial Government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. In my time off from being a full-time firefighter, I trained as SARTEC, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which I acquired privately by training outside the country. I also travelled throughout the North under contract. That year, fires forced the evacuation of 25,000 people across 25 communities. However in 2003, I resigned from my fire department in order to take a Fire Chief‚Äôs position in another Province. I had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in British Columbia where I had been, technically hired. That year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was 54 million dollars. By the end of the summer, the Province of British Columbia had spent 554 million dollars fighting those fires. In the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as I had already resigned my position, I took a position as the Fire Chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in Ontario, Canada in the Region of Niagara. After eight years, I found myself successfully hired as the Fire Chief for a jurisdiction in Alberta, Canada, that surrounded Calgary, Alberta. Within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Provincial Park. The fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. My attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for 150 years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. It is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over 9,000 wells drilled in 2010. I often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? I will never know, but based on what is occurring in Canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. They divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. As my contract ended, and I began a job consulting, in May 2011, a forest fire surrounding Slave Lake, Alberta, home to 7000 people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. The loss amounted to 700 million dollars. Five years later, in May 2016, Fort McMurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of 2,400 structures. The loss amounted to 3.7 billion dollars, just in insured losses. A 2017 study from MacEwan University estimated total losses were in the range of $9 billion dollars. In 2023, Canada‚Äôs most destructive year to date, there were more than 6,000 fires, and 29 mega fires, that burned 41 million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in Canada. Experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. And then this year, Jasper, Alberta, one of the jewels of Canada‚Äôs National Parks saw a fire burn 1,113 structures. None of these occurrences is normal. None of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. They are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, in Lytton, BC, another Canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. The temperatures for the last three years having exceeded 41 C. At some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in Canada in 2021 of 49.2 C or 121 F. This is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. What Does All This Have To Do With Los Angeles? This week Audie Cornish of CNN did a podcast. Her guest was Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist for NASA. His former home, which was destroyed in the Los Angeles community of Altadena, was one of the more than 12,000 homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. Peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, ‚ÄúAs a Climate Scientist, I knew it was time to leave Los Angeles,‚Äù on January 10th, in the New York Times. His personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire 14 years he had lived in Altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to Durham, North Carolina. He did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in Southern California and Nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. And this last week, he was proved right. What is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on Fox and to the incoming President of the United States, a man who hasn‚Äôt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. The problem according to Kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. Less than half of America elected the current President of the United States (49.9%), yet this ‚Äòmandate‚Äô enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. They are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. So, Where is Safe? One of Kalmus‚Äô beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. Not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, 50 years ago, is daunting. Much of what is to come, is baked into our future. Of that, there is certainty. And whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the question remains. Where is safe? Kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. Climate change is global. Obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the United States and Canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. But Ashland, North Carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. So was Lytton, British Columbia. We are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. It will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. And because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. And none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- My name is Ken McMullen. I‚Äôm a retired Director of Emergency Services and former academic.

Eileen Chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. When they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but there‚Äôs no one they can depend on. Actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. Men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. But that‚Äôs not how it is for women. They carry so much more on their shoulders. They can pick up the weight, but they can‚Äôt put it down. It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work.

      "{'Title': 'The Heart That Matters. By Terri Rimmer | by Terri Persico Rimmer | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': \"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Terri Persico Rimmer Follow -- Listen Share The Heart That Matters By Terri Rimmer Shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment Melody‚Äôs neighbor Samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. Fantastic! She thought. The establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. ‚ÄúYou can just give them $5, and they‚Äôll accept that, if you have it,‚Äù Samantha, who used a wheelchair, told Melody. In a few days they went to lunch there with Samantha‚Äôs granddaughter and Melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. She would be back definitely. Over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay ‚Äî or not. She found out though that they did not want her five dollars. They wanted more and made that clear. Two years prior, Melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldn‚Äôt afford to get another vehicle. Because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. She was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. A friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment Melody couldn‚Äôt do the work. Now she‚Äôd been out of a job for four years, the longest she‚Äôd ever been unemployed. Melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldn‚Äôt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. The other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but Melody‚Äôs injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. The third time Melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something Samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. She found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didn‚Äôt mind, except for this group‚Äôs attitude of entitlement. Melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. She was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. But a professional writer/former pet and house sitter also with 40 years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. Melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. And some would ask her for money which she found laughable. The owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didn‚Äôt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. He gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. This was not the person she was. Now it was Christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough she‚Äôd had over a year that she‚Äôd been on over 19 medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. The allergist had given her the answer she‚Äôd been seeking since last year regarding her condition ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt contagious, it wasn‚Äôt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. Whew! She was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. Others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed Melody. The manager took her name, and she didn‚Äôt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. She couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. No sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. ‚ÄúHi, friend,‚Äù he said insincerely. ‚ÄúYou seem like you don‚Äôt feel well.‚Äù Melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didn‚Äôt believe her. ‚ÄúWell, if you can‚Äôt get that coughing under control you can‚Äôt eat today,‚Äù he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. She thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. The woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. The manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. So, once he walked away Melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldn‚Äôt see it. ‚ÄúI know how it is,‚Äù Melody told the woman. ‚ÄúI was in a group home before.‚Äù So, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. Now Melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. As she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. ‚ÄúHonestly, it doesn‚Äôt get any better than the mission here!‚Äù spouted a customer. -- -- I have 41 years of journalism experience having written for ten newspapers, some magazines, and web sites.

I don‚Äôt write down my goals in journals. I don‚Äôt wake up early if I don‚Äôt have to. This ‚ÄúWellness January‚Äù or whatever the hell I‚Äôm having is honestly pretty off-brand.

Here is a list of things that I have quit over the years (that I can remember): And here is a list of things that I have done for a respectable amount of time, to make myself feel better (that I can remember): As I have said before, unless it‚Äôs a necessity, I think life is too short to do things you don‚Äôt want to be doing. Like, people that read a bunch of books just because they want to say they read a certain number of books? Those people concern me. I‚Äôll finish a book if I like it.

Friendly reminder that I am not a medical professional or a social media influencer, so I can‚Äôt actually diagnose that. But here we are, 21 days into January. Still going strong on the no-alcohol front. Stilltryingto go strong on the running front. I‚Äôm not really craving alcohol anymore, and I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm currently elliptical and can‚Äôt properly run for the time-being. My last run was a treadmill run. My knees and my hip started hurting immediately. But my stubborn ass said, ‚ÄúHaha, no‚Äù and I put on another episode of my zombie thing and kept running. Despite the pain, I can confirm that run #6 sucked quite a bit less than run #1. I was able to do my signature slow-jog for about 15 minutes before I stopped, and I only stopped because I needed water. I even started to zone out a little, and think about other things. But now, in addition to fucking up my hip, I also have pretty constant pain my knees. Since those things are all pretty important, I took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). I know PT is something I need to do because I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. However I would MUCH rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. Ugh. Or RUNNING SHOES. But I‚Äôm making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. Anyway, I now have a PT plan to help with the pain. And even though Iknowit will help me feel better, I will certainly not be excited about doing it. I‚Äôm also an instant gratification human, which is another reason that long-term projects are hard for me. I find myself rushing through writing and rushing through art projects just because I want them to bedone.I try to take shortcuts. I don‚Äôt take the time totrulycrease the origami paper, so my cranes always look wonky. I haven‚Äôt felt very inspired on the writing front lately.

      "{'Title': 'Why perfectionism is a hindrance? | by Maryam | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Maryam Follow -- Listen Share Are you also a perfectionist like me? I always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. Under too much pressure to be perfect, I was always an average student because instead of working hard, I kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. This all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. üòî I knew I had to make a change. It wasn‚Äôt an easy process, but I actively decided to find the solution. So, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that I can decide when to stop chasing for it. Learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. In this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve his/her full potential. It‚Äôs the obsession that creates the problem. We just have to know the limits! Do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know it‚Äôs probably unattainable? Why do we do this? Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit. Essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. It encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. From an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently ‚Äòperfect lives\\' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. The flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. This constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. Nobody likes failing, right? Sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. We always think like, ‚ÄúIf I aim high enough, I‚Äôll minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing‚Äù. This fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. üçÇ The problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. Impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. Furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. Excess of anything is harmful. Our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. We are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. These images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. The pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. Many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. By meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. They may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. The ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. But sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. Also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. For some\\xa0of\\xa0us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. We believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. It‚Äôs a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though it‚Äôs often based on flawed assumptions. Many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; it‚Äôs about earning approval and acceptance. -Brene Brown The pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. When we‚Äôre so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. We might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. Ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. Continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. Celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. As Alexander Pope aptly said, ‚Äúto err is human, to forgive divine‚Äù Embrace imperfection and recognize that it‚Äôs a natural part of the human experience. It also helps to reframe our definition of success. Instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. Did we learn something new? Did we overcome a challenge? Those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasn‚Äôt \"perfect.\" Ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. By embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives.

      "{'Title': 'The Silent Enemy: Why Cancer Is Smarter Than You Think | by Saad Elbekri, MD | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Saad Elbekri, MD Follow -- Listen Share Imagine you\\'re sitting in a doctor\\'s office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: \"You have cancer.\" It\\'s shocking. Every day, 60,000 people face this same unexpected reality. Most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: \"I felt perfectly healthy.\" They didn\\'t realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. I have some terrible news: You have a1 in 5 chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. But wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. But here\\'s the catch: It\\'s far more complicated than it seems. Even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting I\\'ve performed. And despite all our training and research ‚Äî doctors still don\\'t fully understand cancer. Cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. Cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. Cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body\\'s defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine\\'s biggest challenges. At its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. Depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. The real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don\\'t follow the rules. Usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body\\'s police force ‚Äî your immune system ‚Äî and removed. Even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: Now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body\\'s defences. This buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. Initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. As the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. When the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. My colleagues and I can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. Still, that\\'s precisely for situations I\\'m getting paid for, and I like it. But here\\'s where it gets tricky: Cancer cells have a unique ability ‚Äî they can take highways through your body to spread. This process is calledmetastasis. There are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: At this point, treatment becomes more complicated. Surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. Usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. Metastasis no longer means the end ‚Äî it just means the treatment needs more personalization. But the big question remains. Damage occurs when the cell\\'s DNA is altered. Cell DNA acts as the user manual for how your cell works. When that manual is damaged, the cell develops DNA mutations, which cause it to malfunction. There are two ways a cell can get damaged: Purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. It\\'s like receiving an altered manual the moment you\\'re born. Cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of DNA damage. Sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. Cancers show up much later. Bad habits usually cause this type of DNA mutation. For example (to name a few): Those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell\\'s DNA, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. Usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. But cancer cells are smarter than you think. The more damage a cell accumulates, the more its DNA gets altered. Cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. Remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. It can now: It\\'s like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. And here is how they do it. Cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body\\'s defences: Yes. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. But there\\'s an even better approach: The best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. Early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. Cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. Your health is worth it.

Every system, every environment, and everything around us requires change after a certain time.

I do not like to entertain an impulse-driven environment because then you just become an enabler, a consumer to the chaos ‚Äî noise. A lot has been happening around us, as always.

Recently, Trump announced a major boost for AI infrastructure in the United States, with private companies planning to invest up to $500 billion over the next four years. A new venture, calledStargate, is being launched by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, according to sources familiar with the deal. Leaders from these companies, including SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman, and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, are expected to join Trump at the White House to make the announcement. The partnership will begin with a $100 billion investment and start its first project ‚Äî a data center in Texas. The plan is to expand to other states over time. Other investors are expected to join, though their identities have not yet been revealed. Stargate aims to create cutting-edge infrastructure to support AI development in the U.S. While spokespeople for SoftBank and OpenAI have not commented, this massive initiative signals a strong push to position the U.S. as a leader in AI technology. Which means AI gets funded, and every crazy idea of AI can be a reality of our future.

In the late 19th century, international efforts to combat diseases like cholera and yellow fever laid the groundwork for cooperation across borders. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the aftermath of World War II that global leaders recognized the need for a central organization to address health issues on a worldwide scale. TheWHOwas officially established on April 7, 1948, a date now celebrated annually as World Health Day. With 61 countries signing its constitution, the WHO marked the beginning of a unified approach to tackling global health challenges. The WHO‚Äôs vision is ambitious yet simple: ‚ÄúHealth for All.‚Äù This encapsulates its mission to ensure that all people have access to essential healthcare services without suffering financial hardship. Its objectives include: The WHO emphasizes collaboration, working with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders to achieve its goals. TheWorld Health Organization‚Äôs work spans a broad spectrum of activities aimed at improving global health. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key functions: The WHO develops guidelines and standards that influence health practices worldwide. For example, it publishes the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a critical tool for tracking and diagnosing diseases. The WHO plays a pivotal role in eradicating and controlling infectious diseases. Its notable successes include the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and its ongoing efforts to eliminate polio. The organization also leads campaigns against malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, providing funding, resources, and technical expertise. During health crises such as pandemics, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks, the WHO steps in to coordinate international responses. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO distributed over 1 billion doses of vaccines through the COVAX initiative, saving countless lives. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are leading causes of death globally. The WHO advocates for preventive measures, such as reducing tobacco use, encouraging physical activity, and promoting healthy diets. The WHO is committed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. Through programs like the Every Woman Every Child initiative, it ensures better access to prenatal care, safe childbirth, and nutrition for mothers and children. Recognizing mental health as an integral part of overall well-being, the WHO works to destigmatize mental illness and improve access to mental health services. Its global mental health action plan emphasizes the need for early intervention and support systems. One of the WHO‚Äôs most celebrated accomplishments is the eradication of smallpox. Through a coordinated vaccination campaign, the disease was officially declared eradicated in 1980, saving millions of lives. Although polio remains endemic in a few regions, the WHO‚Äôs Global Polio Eradication Initiative has brought the world closer to eradicating this crippling disease. For example, cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988. The WHO has been instrumental in the fight against HIV/AIDS. By advocating for antiretroviral therapy and prevention programs, it has significantly reduced the disease‚Äôs impact in many countries.Read More -- -- <a href=\"https://www.myreview24.com/\"> Read Movie Reviews, Entertainment News, Home & Kitchen, Net Worth, News, Trending Topics, Fashion and more</a> Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams'}\n",

By Michael Hodin | by Global Coalition on Aging | Global Coalition on Aging | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': \"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Global Coalition on Aging Follow Global Coalition on Aging -- Listen Share By Michael Hodin Now, in 2025, we have entered the second half of the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing. Five years into this global initiative, what progress have we made? What has the Decade achieved? At this halfway point, businesses and governments have an opportunity to partner even more closely to address the global megatrend of aging ‚Äî a phenomenon so powerful and incontrovertible it‚Äôs reshaping our world. It requires consideration in strategic plans in every sector, and yet is still too often overlooked. Today, more than 2 billion people are aged 55 and older, doubling by mid-century. However, perhaps more consequentially, steeply declining birth rates are leading to depopulation, which, in combination with increased longevity, means societies have more old than young around the world. It‚Äôs an unprecedented demographic shift, the impact of which rivals that of the industrial revolution or the advent of the internet and all the technology that followed. As we adapt to this societal transformation, a few specific areas of focus stand out: Healthcare and technology.We must prioritize innovation in healthcare and technology to enable the healthier aging promised in the Decade‚Äôs vision. By focusing onpreventionandinnovative treatments, we can support healthy aging and unlock the potential of the ‚Äúsilver economy.‚Äù A healthy older population can drive robust economic growth, continuing the societal advancements achieved over the past two centuries. Work and retirement.We also need to rethink how and how long people work. The traditional retirement ages of 60 or 65 no longer make sense in a world with fewer young workers and longer, healthier lives. Employers who want to win must find ways toattract and retain older employees, even into their 80s. This is especially urgent in OECD countries, where aging populations and declining birth rates are changing the workforce landscape dramatically. Business.For businesses, understanding the aging trend isn‚Äôt optional ‚Äî yet businesses still seem not to get it. It‚Äôs a competitive advantage in talent attraction and retention, business commercial strategies, and reputational value. Older people are anenormous and diverse marketfor businesses looking to grow and create value. Older adults hold the majority of wealth and disposable income. In the U.S., for example, 70% of disposable income is controlled by people aged 60 and older. This demographic offers enormous opportunities for sectors like travel, consumer goods, transportation, housing, and technology, even as healthcare and financial services are more focused. Public policy.Public systems designed in the mid-20th century are ill-equipped to meet today‚Äôs age demographic realities. Take health and pension systems: the UK‚Äôs NHS, established in 1947, or the U.S.‚Äôs Medicare or Social Security, established in 1965 and 1935 respectively, will struggle to remain sustainable in light of today‚Äôs demographic realities.

      "{'Title': 'Not Just Another Year Older. By Michael Hodin | by Global Coalition on Aging | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Global Coalition on Aging Follow -- Listen Share By Michael Hodin Now, in 2025, we have entered the second half of the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing. Five years into this global initiative, what progress have we made? What has the Decade achieved? At this halfway point, businesses and governments have an opportunity to partner even more closely to address the global megatrend of aging ‚Äî a phenomenon so powerful and incontrovertible it‚Äôs reshaping our world. It requires consideration in strategic plans in every sector, and yet is still too often overlooked. Today, more than 2 billion people are aged 55 and older, doubling by mid-century. However, perhaps more consequentially, steeply declining birth rates are leading to depopulation, which, in combination with increased longevity, means societies have more old than young around the world. It‚Äôs an unprecedented demographic shift, the impact of which rivals that of the industrial revolution or the advent of the internet and all the technology that followed. As we adapt to this societal transformation, a few specific areas of focus stand out: Healthcare and technology.We must prioritize innovation in healthcare and technology to enable the healthier aging promised in the Decade‚Äôs vision. By focusing onpreventionandinnovative treatments, we can support healthy aging and unlock the potential of the ‚Äúsilver economy.‚Äù A healthy older population can drive robust economic growth, continuing the societal advancements achieved over the past two centuries. Work and retirement.We also need to rethink how and how long people work. The traditional retirement ages of 60 or 65 no longer make sense in a world with fewer young workers and longer, healthier lives. Employers who want to win must find ways toattract and retain older employees, even into their 80s. This is especially urgent in OECD countries, where aging populations and declining birth rates are changing the workforce landscape dramatically. Business.For businesses, understanding the aging trend isn‚Äôt optional ‚Äî yet businesses still seem not to get it. It‚Äôs a competitive advantage in talent attraction and retention, business commercial strategies, and reputational value. Older people are anenormous and diverse marketfor businesses looking to grow and create value. Older adults hold the majority of wealth and disposable income. In the U.S., for example, 70% of disposable income is controlled by people aged 60 and older. This demographic offers enormous opportunities for sectors like travel, consumer goods, transportation, housing, and technology, even as healthcare and financial services are more focused. Public policy.Public systems designed in the mid-20th century are ill-equipped to meet today‚Äôs age demographic realities. Take health and pension systems: the UK‚Äôs NHS, established in 1947, or the U.S.‚Äôs Medicare or Social Security, established in 1965 and 1935 respectively, will struggle to remain sustainable in light of today‚Äôs demographic realities. At the time of those public institutional creations, life expectancies were shorter and ‚Äúold age‚Äù was a rarity. Today, as we appreciate longevity to a hundred, how does it not make sense to overhaul those institutions of society? Policy reforms are necessary to adapt to a world of more old than young.

Treasuring thefirsttime seeing the result of his labor from whacking thick pods with a knife and piling the milky beans in a heap before drying later for shipment, an older guy, as he sat among workers, mostly in flip-flops and dingy shirts, held the unwrapped chocolate bar up to talk, basking in his moment of glory. Impatiently, their hands reached out until he mentioned his obligation as the eldest to taste what the stranger had given him. When he finally indulged himself, the sweetness immediately spread across his lips into a smile. Earlier, another laborer, prompted by a flashing notion, had shared what he thought with others, one of several comments the group associated with eating chocolate. ‚ÄúThis is why white people are so healthy.‚Äù Saving the wrapper in his pocket after passing the rest to others, the eldest there declared that he would take it home to show to his family, so proud of his discovery of chocolate, a delicacy forcenturiesin many parts of the world, especially oncecompaniespoured in enough milk and sugar to keep dentists and physicians in business, as patients succumbed to cavities and a litany of diseases from obesity. Count me as one of the many who enjoyed those delectable desires sweetened for addiction. Switching over gradually to the kind without any added sweetness took years before I got used to the taste. Even now, I chase that bitterness down with a banana or a pinch of raisins and constantly keep an eye on the scale, adjusting daily desires by the ounce, because I treasure good health. Otherwise, I‚Äôd eat up a few sizes from all the frigid temperatures that have kept me in this season. Jazzed bysnow, the most, from what I read online, since Valentine‚Äôs of 1895, Fat Tuesday came early for strollers in New Orleans, as unseemly weather shut down the city, while also giving mothers a reason to celebrate with their kids who, like that guy tasting chocolate first, smiled wide at the sight of soft mounds piling atop cars and layering lawns everywhere ‚Äî a memory imprinted forever in a treasured click for a photo album, adding to the joy from a day off from schoolwork. First times, as well as final ones, occupy a special place that we embrace more emotionally than whatever happened before or afterward ‚Äî whether in a tasted desire or prized memory. Memories of those first moments often last throughout life, adding layers of context for comparison as we mature and grow through the years. Once we add similar moments, that original impression slowly depreciates until it loses its luster, the charm of what made it precious in the first place. Eyes that once dazzled look elsewhere now at a dinner table. Instead of connecting deeply to refresh the feeling that we promised to hold on to forever, we slip into going through the motions of just another habit ‚Äî a hug without meaning more, just another piece of chocolate for our lips. Valentine‚Äôs Day, as well as a couple of other days throughout the year, particularly the annual sale of Leonidas Chocolate, usually brings on an urge for me to resist perhaps my favorite temptation for a delicacy. However, a frozen winter of singleness has one advantage going for it ‚Äî buying less processed chocolate to sprinkle in for a random occasion, especially with fewer bouquets of scented petals that wilt by the week. Despite missing out on delectable treats that whet my appetite each year, I manage to flavor bitter nibs daily and savor them with fruit to suit my taste. Consequently, I refresh an edible joy that keeps me coming back for more each day, though rather hard-pressed to remember that first taste of chocolate ever. If I reacted similarly to the man in the video after that first bite of chocolate, my impression faded quickly amid sweetness packaged on shelves easily within reach, perhaps in preparing me for a world filled with irresistible eye candy often painted on lips. This morning‚Äôs reading treasures wisdom that knows which desires mean more and which pleasures require greater self-discipline. Each day, we encounter a new opportunity to improve on the day before or just drift back to the pack of mediocrity ‚Äî that first nibble for a taste of what lies ahead or fresh snow for a memory in years to come.

In an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ‚Äî AI-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. Yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasn‚Äôt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. Many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. After all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary AI model is what attracts funding and headlines. But here‚Äôs the catch: digital health is not just about technology; it‚Äôs about people. Whether it‚Äôs convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. In fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô side of the business. To be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. A leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. However, technology alone can‚Äôt explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. It‚Äôs the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. Think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? Or one who can design a wearable but can‚Äôt address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? In digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. Technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but it‚Äôs time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code. Communication, empathy, and relationship-building are not optional ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential.

The dye was alreadybanned in 1990in cosmetics for causing cancer in lab rats who ingested it. Fast forward 35 years, to yesterday, when it is finally banned in food, when we knew all along it caused cancer ifeaten. It was also‚Äúrestricted‚Äùin the EU in 1994, with allowance in cocktail cherries, aka Maraschino cherries. Maraschino cherries ‚Äî a preserved, candied cherry,originally never used dye in the first place. Created in Europe, the spirit companyLuxardo(who claims ownership), released them in 1821, using alcohol and sugar as the preservative. Eventually the cherries made their way to the US and then prohibition happened. in the 1920s, a professor in Oregon created his own version using calcium salts and brine as a preservative, which removed the coloring, so he added back coloring, artificially, giving them their bright red color. This colorant was banned in the 60s for causing cancer, so manufacturers started using another artificial colorant ‚Äî Red 40, which also causes cancer and neurological issues in humans. Red 40 is still used today in Maraschino cherries and many other foods and drinks and cosmetics. Let‚Äôs review. I am going to make this short and sweet. Just like us, large organizations, governments, charities, corporations also want self preservation, but the want it for the ‚Äúorganizations‚Äù interest aka the shareholders/stakeholders. They may employ humans like you and me, but they employ them to work on their behalf. Why do humans comply? The paycheck they receive serves their own self-interests enough to make them do things they know are not benefiting others. Nothing will change until we demand it. Power is never given back, and rarely is money. If we want to take our power back, we need to take power away from entities who are not protecting us. Growth is not in the ‚Äúbig‚Äù it is found in small, local community efforts where everyone has a say. But even community boards suffer from power trips. We need a system that is easily accessible and readily available to all, to share their voice and be a part of the final decision This won‚Äôt happen how we do it now. We ALL have to work and get involved. We have to read, do research. Social media is not research. Learn to read a medical study. We have to stop looking for a knight in shining armor to save us and also stop looking for it in the same places.

      "{'Title': 'Healing Humanity or Modern Eugenics? CRISPR Determines the Future of Human Evolution | by Shaelin Gorny | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shaelin Gorny Follow -- Listen Share Imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. A world where individuals don‚Äôt spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like Huntington‚Äôs disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. A world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. This is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. But alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. A dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where CRISPR places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. While genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. In 2018,Chinese scientist He Jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to HIV, resulting in the birth of twin girls(Raposo). Globally,42.3 million people have died from HIV, yet with CRISPR, no more have to (‚ÄúHIV‚Äù). While this trial showcased gene editing‚Äôs revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.The experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(‚ÄúWhat are the Ethical Concerns‚Ä¶?‚Äù). A clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. But what happens when scientific experimentation isn‚Äôt strictly monitored? In the cases of theTuskegee Syphilis Study,Henrietta Lacks,Nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: Catastrophe. This same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of Nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. What happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? Prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them ‚Äî a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. Evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.A 2018 study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens‚Äô adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(Agha et al.). Narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. However, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. This technology could end generations of suffering.Genome mutations cause roughly 7,000 known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (‚ÄúUsing gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases‚Äù). CRISPR technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as Huntington‚Äôs disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable ‚Äîcurrent treatment costs of $2.2 million reflect the high expense of novel technologies‚Äî it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (Pagliarulo and Lucas). Unfortunately, humans won‚Äôt stop at disease eradication. If we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldn‚Äôt we? Enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. Targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. Take theCCR5-Œî32 mutation, which Chinese scientist He Jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(Sanders). This mutation prohibits HIV infection, yetincreases susceptibility to West Nile virus and leads to a 21% higher overall mortality rate(Sanders). This is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. Eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. Additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(‚ÄúAccelerating Global Access to Gene Therapies‚Äù). While disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. Enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. What may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. Such pursuits are simply indefensible. What is the true cost of progress? When ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? Well, let‚Äôs review a familiar example. What did He Jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? Prison. Reckless application of CRISPR technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. But on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? If genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist ‚Äî it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.The World Health Organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(‚ÄúHealth Ethics & Governance‚Äù). Without enforcement, these measures are futile. CRISPR holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. But if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. This isn‚Äôt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. As a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing? The choice ‚Äî and the responsibility ‚Äî belongs to all of us.

Understanding Cardiodiabesity's Threat‚Ä¶ | by Luis Cisneros | Jan, 2025 | Medium\", 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Luis Cisneros Follow -- 1 Listen Share In discussions about America‚Äôs most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. Yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. This complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. It‚Äôs a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Research by Evernorth reveals a startling statistic: 93% of adults in the United States suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. This figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. The rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. Between 1999 and 2020, adult obesity rates soared from 30.5% to 41.9%. If current trends persist, half of all American adults could be classified as obese by 2030. But this is far from a superficial issue ‚Äì it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of $719 billion annually. To put this into perspective, consider Sarah, a 45-year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. Her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. Over time, she developed type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. Sarah‚Äôs story mirrors that of millions of Americans. Collectively, the costs associated with obesity ($173 billion), heart disease and stroke ($219 billion), and diabetes ($327 billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. These expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity ‚Äì making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. While individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. Social and economic factors account for 40% of health outcomes, according to public health data. These include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability ‚Äì all of which shape an individual‚Äôs ability to maintain good health. The physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (10%), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for 20% and 30%, respectively. This breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. ‚ÄúIt is better to prevent than to cure. ‚Äì Ibn Sina‚Äù The encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable ‚Äì and, in many cases, reversible. Early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. A variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. Take, for instance, the initiative led by Cigna Healthcare in partnership with Virgin Pulse. By allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. Statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. Families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. The impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. Addressing cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a moral imperative ‚Äì it‚Äôs an economic one. Companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. On a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. Much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. Healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. Integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. The stakes are enormous. Cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a set of disconnected health problems ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of American life, from families to workplaces to entire communities. This is not a challenge we can address piecemeal or delay for another generation. If we fail to act, millions will continue to face shortened lives, mounting medical bills, and preventable suffering. We‚Äôve seen what coordinated action can do in the face of major health threats like cancer or heart disease. It‚Äôs time to bring that same urgency and focus to cardiodiabesity. The longer we wait, the more lives and resources we lose to a crisis that we already know how to address. This isn‚Äôt just about statistics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about people, families, and futures that don‚Äôt have to be cut short. The responsibility to address this crisis can no longer be postponed. -- -- 1 CEO and Founder of Nudge Health Visit us atwww.mynudgehealth.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams'}\n",

Alcohol has been around forever and will be around for a long time. Some people are able to drink a glass occasionally for celebration and many people can not. Those are the people who I see as an addiction nurse. People who suffer from trauma, and pain, got into the notion of covering the pain by drinking alcohol to numb the painful memories. I had seen people become addicted to alcohol as a child as they were given regular drinks by parents, aunts, abusers, and more. A devastating cycle. I believe everyone deserves a chance to get out of addiction. I believe addiction is not a choice. People can easily get lost in the path down on the addiction road and can find it very difficult to get out. Many people drink socially feeling they need to do so to follow the societal norm.

      "{'Title': 'Why Parents Should Include Their Children In Organized Sports | by Emory Menefee | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emory Menefee Follow -- Listen Share Why Parents Should Include Their Children In Organized Sports It‚Äôs important that parents put their kids in organized sports while growing up as it has many benefits such as maintaining strong health, heightened concentration in school, as well as psychological and social benefits as they progress into adulthood. I can vouch that sports have shaped the person I am today and helped me overcome the obstacles I encountered while growing up. When my parents separated and went through the divorce process, sports were a pivotal outlet for me. It was an area of freedom and fun away from my outside life. As a young adult who has suffered from anxiety and depression since I was thirteen due to the things happening with my family, I can say without a doubt that sports saved me. Many of my fondest memories and accomplishments came from being in sports, like scoring the game winning goal with thirty-one seconds left my junior year to be crowned the league champions with my soccer team. I don‚Äôt get the best moment of my life without organized sports. For starters, physical activity helps maintain strong health. Exercising is one of the best ways to keep children in shape and to help prevent diseases and illnesses. (National Institutes of Health, 2016). Studies showed that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of injuries, different types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer, as well as reducing risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure. The American Journal of Preventive Medicine said after school physical programs have reduced obesity the most. Having your kids stay active would help reduce lower medical care as they would be healthier more often which also results in less financial burdens. As mothers and fathers, one of your main goals in life is to always keep your kids safe, and having kids in organized sports keeps your kids healthy which helps towards that goal. Kids participating in organized sports growing up have shown to translate into benefits in the learning environment. A study that followed children from kindergarten to fourth grade showed that physical activities help children to develop and improve their cognitive skills. It has been associated with children getting better grades and doing better on standardized tests. Physical activity has also been shown to improve attitudes and academic behavior including ‚Äúenhanced concentration and attention‚Äù (GAO, 2012). Sports have always motivated me to have higher concentration in my academics to make sure I maintained solid grades. My parents would not allow me to participate in my sports if my grades weren‚Äôt good. That extra incentive while growing up helped me especially in middle school to stay focused and committed to getting good grades. Those good grades alongside sports helped me get admitted into a selective prep high school. Studies on the high school age group showed that teenagers who participated in sports are more likely to attend college and get degrees than non-athletes. Studies have shown that sports can have beneficial effects on individuals even into their adulthoods, which explained that the benefits extend into the workplace. A survey of 400 female corporate executives found that 94% played a sport growing up and 61% said it beneficially impacted their career success. (EY Women Athletes Business Network/espnW, 2014). Additionally, physical activity has also been proven to have a positive impact on mental health and social skills. Kids who are involved in physical activity have reported to have more excitement, more happiness and motivation in their day to day lives, whereas kids who are inactive reported greater nervousness, anxiety, depression, and worry. Physical activity has been shown to boost self-esteem, leadership, and goal-setting skills. A 2019 study found that children who reported to have no physical activity in their life were twice as likely to have mental health issues. According to the United Nations, sports have been proven to provide a safe environment and community for many participants. They may be having trouble at school or having issues at home. Organized sports have helped kids find an outlet from their everyday lives. It helps unite these kids to learn how to work together in a manner that also teaches them to learn the value of teamwork and respect. Additionally, it helps teach children at a young age to develop a passion for something. I fell in love with soccer and basketball when I was three. I developed many of the friendships and relationships I hold dear to this day. The community I fostered at a young age never faltered. I still reach out to old coaches I have had in the past for advice and guidance. I still keep in touch with old teammates and all of us wish each other success and happiness whenever we see one another accomplishing the goals we set when we were younger. I acknowledge that organized sports as the years progress the cost to participate also increases. There‚Äôs a fee for equipment, travel cost, hotel and food. My parents paid for me to play club soccer from age ten to eighteen. Countless practices and games. Many tournaments required us to travel to different states. Different jerseys, shorts, and socks each and every year. I agree that it can add up. When I spoke to my parents, I had asked them if they regretted any of it and they said no. They were just proud of where their daughter is today.

You try to rest, to let go, but the moment you close your eyes, the thoughts come rushing in.Did I do enough today? Did I say the right thing? What about tomorrow?It‚Äôs like trying to swim in quicksand ‚Äî the harder you fight, the deeper you sink. Rest isn‚Äôt just lying down; it‚Äôs surrendering, and for some of us, surrender feels dangerous. The silence of stillness can be deafening, amplifying all the doubts and fears we‚Äôve spent the day trying to drown out. We tell ourselves we‚Äôll rest later, after we‚Äôve done more, fixed more, achieved more. But later never comes, and the exhaustion grows, until even the idea of rest feels impossible. Somewhere along the way, we learned to equate rest with laziness, with failure.If you stop, you‚Äôll fall behind.If you rest, you‚Äôre weak.These lies become our truth, and we wear our exhaustion like a badge of honor, proof that we‚Äôre working hard, trying hard, living hard. But deep down, we know the truth: we‚Äôre breaking. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôve convinced yourself that your worth is tied to how much you do, how much you give, how much you endure. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôre afraid of what might surface in the quiet ‚Äî the fears you‚Äôve buried, the grief you‚Äôve ignored, the parts of yourself you‚Äôve been too scared to face. Just like your heart needs a beat of silence between every pulse, you need moments to pause, to breathe, to simply exist without expectation. Rest isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness; it‚Äôs an act of courage. It‚Äôs saying,I choose to care for myself, even when the world tells me I shouldn‚Äôt. And yes, it‚Äôs terrifying. Slowing down feels like losing control. But control is an illusion anyway. The world will keep spinning whether you‚Äôre running yourself into the ground or taking a moment to recover. The difference is, when you choose rest, you give yourself a chance to heal, to rebuild, to carry on without breaking completely. So, if you feel like you can‚Äôt stop ‚Äî stop anyway. Not forever, not all at once, but for a moment. Let the world wait. Let the guilt scream and the doubts whisper. Sit with them. Breathe through them. And remind yourself of this truth:you are not your productivity. Your value isn‚Äôt measured by how much you give to others but by the fact that you are here, alive, trying. Even if rest feels impossible now, it‚Äôs not. Start small ‚Äî a breath, a pause, a moment of stillness. You deserve to be whole, not just what‚Äôs left after everyone else has taken their share. You deserve peace, even when the world doesn‚Äôt offer it freely. And most of all, you deserve rest ‚Äî because you‚Äôve carried enough for today. -- -- Navigating mental health, and something about growth.

My father-in-law from Xxxxxxx happened to be in the area visiting his sister and took my husband to Community North. We called an ambulance for me because I couldn‚Äôt move and was gasping for air. We believe we were diagnosed with botulism in a timely manner because we went in together. By all looks of things, my husband, a fifty-year-old, looked like he was having a stroke. What we conjecture is that his symptoms along with my descending paralysis from the head down was how they caught it. By then, the paralysis had reached my diaphragm and I could no longer breathe on my own. By the Grace of God and excellent medical care, a doctor recognized our combined symptoms as botulism. There is a test for botulism, and that takes four days. I think without intervention, I would have been dead within hours. The doctor called the CDC and an anti-toxin was flown in from Chicago. The anti-toxin was administered, and we lived. My husband left the hospital, walking with a cane breathing on his own, in three weeks. My exposure must have been more extreme because I was a lot sicker. After two days of struggling to breath, I was intubated after what can only be categorized as a near death experience. I later had a tracheostomy and breathed through a tube in my neck for eight weeks. It took me a full twelve weeks to recover from the paralysis to walk and talk again. It has been five months, and I still have to walk with a walker. That is one heck of a story, right? So why is our case on the CDC or Indiana Health Department‚Äôs website? I called the Indiana Health Department and they said there has to be at least ten cases in order for it to be worthy of public record. Two cases of botulism are two cases too many. I understand because of HIPPA, that my anonymity is paramount, but so is public health. I am willing to out myself to bring attention to this deadly, but treatable disease. Yes, botulism is rare and only deadly in five percent of cases, if it is caught in time. Many of my doctors and nurses said they haven‚Äôt seen a botulism case in twenty years. That doesn‚Äôt mean that there were unreported botulism because it was not diagnosed in time. Undiagnosed botulism looks like heart failure or unexplained pnemonia. I was lucky and healthy enough to recover. I was lucky to have insurance and to live in Indianapolis with access to top notch health centers like Community North and Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana (RHI). I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to have the forty pounds to lose in two months. I had no underlying conditions. You change one factor, and I‚Äôm dead of suffocation or heart failure in the first twenty-four hours, or I‚Äôm dead of pneumonia in two weeks. I am a miracle of luck and medical science, and no one outside of my inner circle knows about it. I want everyone to know about it. Our food supply chain is already shaky because of monopolies, and I fear with the incoming administration and the overturning of the Chevron decision that essentially weakened Federal agencies, such as the FDA, things will get worse.

      "{'Title': 'Sit-to-Stand Desks: a Small Change for a Big Impact | by Margaret Fennebresque | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Margaret Fennebresque Follow -- Listen Share With around ‚Öì of the child population overweight or obese and 40% unable to read at a basic level, I think we can all agree that good health and academic optimization are two things America needs more of (Fiorenzi;Literacy Statistics 2022‚Äì2023). What if I were to tell you that there is a simple action that American schools can take that addresses both health complications and academic hardships? Well, I hope you‚Äôre on the edge of your seat because I want you to get out of it. That‚Äôs right‚Äì stand up, as my research has led me to believe that the solution is standing! American schools should transition to sit-to-stand desks to take advantage of the plethora of benefits to standing instead of sitting, ranging from hindering health issues like diabetes and ADHD to cultivating academic success by improving mood and averting hours of unproductivity. Tens of thousands of hours of every American‚Äôs life is spent at school, and 65‚Äì70% of this time is spent sitting down (Leech;Prepwise).Sitting is the new smoking, you might have heard, and this claim is backed by findings linking health complications such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease to sedentary time (Fiorenzi). Fortunately, standing desks, being on the path to movement, aids in combating each of such complications. Standing burns more calories than sitting, averaging an additional 50 calories per hour in adults, and studies have shown that obese or overweight children burn even more than their healthy-weight peers (Fiorenzi). Standing has been found to reduce blood sugar spikes after meals, a benefit especially helpful for diabetics but good for everyone since ‚Äúgreater amplitudes of glycemic variability have been linked to circulatory oxidative stress‚Äù (Jubbal). Standing is also connected with better heart health, as a study consisting of sitting and standing bus drivers observed that the standing drivers‚Äô risk for heart disease was half of that of the sitting drivers (Leech). If standing were to become the social norm, both the physiological perks and a new social pressure to be healthy enough to stand for longer periods would hinder health complications in the American school population. Consistent with the correlation between better health and academic achievement, sit-to-stand desks provide users with a better learning experience by optimizing key factors to academic success, including productivity, mood, and attention (Kurniawan;Schmidt;Valiente). One of the more obvious perks of a standing desk is postural improvement; good posture naturally reduces back, neck and sciatica pain (Leech). According to astudy, patients suffering from chronic pain had an average reduction of 9.8 hours of work productivity per week. I‚Äôm not sure about you, but I can learn quite a lot in almost 10 hours. A lesser known perk of a standing desk is its effect on mood: a positive one to be more specific. In one study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue and 87% reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day and after returning to sitting desks their moods reverted to their original levels (Leech). This study complements other research finding sitting and sedentary lifestyles linked with increased risks of depression and anxiety (Leech). As a student, I can attest that maintaining a positive outlook has pushed me to take risks that have led to my own academic success. Although you might have expected that standing desks would create distraction for children, I have found far more evidence suggesting just the opposite. I acknowledge that there is some anecdotal evidence documenting young children bumping into one another while using standing desks, however, recall that chairs create similar distractions including rocking, footsie, and leg swinging (‚ÄúThe Effects of Standing Desks‚Äù). On the other hand, one study demonstrated that students using standing desks exhibited ‚Äúsignificant improvements in attention and inhibitory control compared to their sitting peers,‚Äù and schoolchildren in the experiment group of another study that used standing-desks were found to be between 12 and 25% more engaged than the control group (Fiorenzi;Otto). Dr. Mark Benden of Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health explains this finding well: ‚ÄúWhen kids sit at a desk all day, they don‚Äôt have to use any energy, which means they can just as easily fall asleep, daydream, or distract themselves by distracting others‚Äù (Fiorenzi). At least for me, it ismuchharder to fall asleep standing up. Considering that standing expends more energy than sitting, it‚Äôs logical that distraction would be reduced, a boon particularly for millions of American children diagnosed with ADD or ADHD (Fiorenzi). Hopefully at this point, you‚Äôre convinced that standing desks have immense benefits. You may still be wondering, though, is it worth the effort to replace all sitting desks with standing desks? Allow me to clarify what I mean by ‚Äútransitioning to sit-to-stand desks.‚Äù It‚Äôd be a waste to toss out perfectly adequate sitting desks already owned, but I do think that when schools are in the market for new desks, they should purchase sit-to-stand desks. Sit-to-stand desks allow users to adjust the height of the desk, giving them the option to sit or stand, thereby taking into consideration the needs of physically disabled children and providing flexibility for various activities. Lastly, whereas the monetary price of sit-to-stand desks might be slightly more than that of a sitting-only desk, having the ability to make use of the numerous, substantial advantages of standing sure seem to outweigh that small cost differential. If you believe in having a healthy, educated population, I urge you to use your influence as a student, parent, teacher, staff member, administrator, or alumni to advocate for sit-to-stand desks in your school.

But researchers aren‚Äôt just focused on adding years ‚Äî they‚Äôre looking to extend health alongside lifespan. A recent study offers a glimpse into what may be possible: combining two FDA-approved drugs,trametinibandrapamycin, resulted in a significant lifespan increase in mice, while also improving their health in old age. Researchers gave one group of mice trametinib, another group rapamycin, and a third group a combination of the two. The results were striking: ‚Ä¢Trametinib aloneextended median lifespan by7%‚Äì10%, depending on sex. ‚Ä¢Rapamycin aloneincreased lifespan by17%‚Äì18%. ‚Ä¢ Thecombination of both drugsshowed the most dramatic effects, boosting lifespan by35% in femalesand27% in males. What‚Äôs more, the maximum lifespan (the longest any mice lived) increased significantly when both drugs were used together, highlighting their additive benefits. Both drugs target different cellular pathways involved in aging: ‚Ä¢Trametinibworks on a pathway that regulates cell growth. ‚Ä¢Rapamycininhibits a pathway linked to inflammation and age-related diseases. By combining these mechanisms, the drugs created a stronger anti-aging effect than either could achieve alone. Extending lifespan is one thing, but how did the micefeelas they aged? Researchers found the drug combo also improved key markers of health: ‚Ä¢Heart health:Delayed age-related decline in heart function. ‚Ä¢Tumors:Reduced tumor growth and overall tumor load. ‚Ä¢Inflammation:Lowered inflammation in the brain and body. However, it wasn‚Äôt all good news. Some mice experienced side effects like fatty liver disease and testicular degeneration, raising questions about how these drugs might work in humans. Both trametinib and rapamycin are FDA-approved, but for very different uses: ‚Ä¢Trametinibtreats certain types of cancer. ‚Ä¢Rapamycinis used after organ transplants to prevent rejection. The fact that these drugs are already approved opens the door for further research into their potential as longevity treatments. However, what works in mice doesn‚Äôt always translate to humans. Animal studies like this are an exciting starting point, but testing in humans could take decades. Scientists are now exploring whether combining even more drugs ‚Äî like diabetes medications metformin and acarbose ‚Äî could create an even stronger anti-aging effect. The goal is to target multiple cellular pathways to not only extend lifespan but also reduce age-related diseases. But before you get too excited, remember: it‚Äôs still early days. While these findings are promising, the path from lab to human trials is long and full of challenges. This study highlights the potential of drug combinations to unlock new frontiers in longevity research. While human applications are still far off, these findings show that targeting multiple aging pathways could be the key to living not just longer, but healthier lives.

      "{'Title': 'Meta Fires its Fact-Checkers: What does this mean for health misinformation? | by Nutrix AI | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Nutrix AI Follow -- Listen Share Picture this, you‚Äôre scrolling through Instagram and you see a fit man on his porch in Bali, waving his finger at the screen and telling you about a miracle detox tea. He claims that rigorous studies have proved it to increase weight loss by 200%‚Ä¶ Incredible, right? And how helpful of him to include an Amazon affiliate link where you can buy the tea‚Ä¶ Well, since Meta recently announced that they‚Äôll be removing fact-checking from its platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Threads), you‚Äôre left with the question of how you‚Äôll determine if the miracle tea is a hoax with fabricated statistics or a genuine scientific discovery. In Meta‚Äôs press video, CEO Mark Zuckerberg justifies the decision by saying that fact-checkers were too politically biased, and were making too many false positives ‚Äî taking down posts that didn‚Äôt spread erroneous facts. Additionally, he believes this is a step toward supporting free speech, supposedly a Meta and American value. Whether we resonate with Meta‚Äôs decision or not, those of us who work in healthcare, or merely care about our health, are left wondering where we‚Äôll get our health information from. According to a survey by the National Library of Medicine, 85% of people seek health information using social media, including WhatsApp, YouTube, and Facebook. Although the survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia, it can likely be generalized to most places, since we‚Äôre increasingly chronically online globally. This means we have to be extra cautious about the health information we share and consume online. Without the help of fact-checkers, how can you separate fact from fiction? If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Health improvements take time, consistency, and evidence-based methods. 2. Question the Source Look for advice from credible voices like licensed nutritionists, scientists, or reputable organizations ‚Äî not just influencers with slick branding. AtNutrix AI, we‚Äôre building a platform with evidence-based and easy-to-understand nutrition advice. 3. Ask the Why Behind the Claim When presented with a bold claim, ask: ‚ÄúWhy does this work?‚Äù If the person can‚Äôt explain beyond surface-level buzzwords, treat it as a red flag. For every answer they give, follow up with another ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù 4. Think Twice Before You Share What‚Äôs more dangerous than following ill-advised health advice? Sharing it with all of your friends and followers and putting them in danger too. Pause for a moment before sharing that Instagram reel or sending that message in a WhatsApp group, and ask yourself ‚ÄúHow safe and robust is this claim?‚Äù We live in an era where information is more accessible than ever, empowering billions to make informed decisions about their health. But with this abundance comes the challenge of distinguishing valuable insights from dangerous misinformation. Meta‚Äôs decision to remove fact-checkers doesn‚Äôt have to leave us adrift. Instead, it‚Äôs a call to action: to approach health advice with a critical eye, to rely on trusted sources, and to be mindful of the impact our shares have on others. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams'}\n",

In the past few years, the word ‚Äúdelulu‚Äù has become prominent, particularly within online forums and social media platforms namely Tiktok. Coming from the term ‚Äúdelusional,‚Äù it is commonly used to refer to someone who has a strong belief in an unreasonable or impossible event. This word gave birth to another trending term ‚ÄúDelulu is the solulu‚Äù.

What seemed harmless at first turned into a major health lesson. During winter, I didn‚Äôt feel thirsty and thought coffee was enough to keep me hydrated. The warm comfort of a steaming cup seemed perfect for the season. However, I overlooked the fact that coffee is a diuretic, which means it causes the body to lose water.

Then almost as an afterthought, she added:‚Äú‚Ä¶that is, if you get to keep them both.‚Äù Before you jump to any conclusions,I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.I didn‚Äôt take a hit to the groin, try a weird yoga pose, or do anything unusual in the bedroom. It was a normal sunny morning, full of possibilities until it was obliterated by a sudden pain in my left testicle. At first, it was just a twinge, but every time I moved, it got worse. Still, it wasn‚Äôt agony. Definitely not‚Äúrush to the hospital‚Äùterritory. Besides, I had plans. It was a big New Year‚Äôs Eve bash and nothing was going to ruin that. Except, of course, my balls. In the end, the pain became impossible to ignore, and I had to tell my friends I couldn‚Äôt make it out. Luckily, they were supportive and one of them sent me a medical helpline number and told me to call. Naturally, like anyone in need of an expert‚Äôs opinion, I turned to Google. Testicular torsion ‚Äî a condition where the spermatic cord twists, cutting off blood flow to the testicle ‚Äî kept appearing with urgent warnings to act within six hours. But I‚Äôd been in pain all day so I was‚Äútechnically‚Äùsafe. But that wasn‚Äôt the real reason I didn‚Äôt call right away‚Ä¶ The truth is, I have small, some might say (not me) ladylike hands. And I couldn‚Äôt stop picturing dropping my pants and having my dynamic duo manhandled by some ogre of a man‚Äôs giant hands, like a gorilla fumbling with cherries. So, I made the crucial mistake of sleeping on it.‚ÄúIf it still hurts in the morning,‚ÄùI decided,‚Äúthen I‚Äôll call the number.‚Äù So, after a night of very little sleep and multiple testicle-related nightmares, I dialed the helpline. The medical questions came fast, and I was nailing them.‚ÄúNo,‚ÄùI said confidently (and truthfully) to everything: swelling?No.Fever?Nope.The wrong colour?God, no. I was breezing through their questions, and by the time they‚Äôd finished, I felt like I‚Äôd just aced a maths test. ‚ÄúAre you alone?‚Äùthe lady asked, breaking my self-congratulatory haze.‚ÄúI‚Äôm with my parents,‚ÄùI replied.‚ÄúGood, because you need to get to the hospital immediately!‚ÄùMy stomach sank as she delivered the bombshell diagnosis:‚ÄúIt might be testicular torsion.‚Äù As I sat in the car, panic rising in my chest, I couldn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd let something as stupid as my fear of big hands keep me from getting help sooner. Would I really rather lose a ball than let a big-handed man touch me? Apparently, yes. And now I wondered if my hesitation had cost me everything. At the hospital, I found some small comfort in the fact that, so far, only women had been tasked with examining my precious cargo. First, a kind nurse asked a few questions, then a calm technician performed an ultrasound ‚Äî no sign of any gorilla-handed ogre-men. But then the results came back.‚ÄúYou need to get to another hospital,‚Äùthey said.‚ÄúNow.‚Äù Suddenly, I was in an ambulance, sirens blaring, racing toward a urologist who would decide the fate of my crown jewels. That‚Äôs when it hit me: this wasn‚Äôt a joke, and my balls weren‚Äôt going to wait for me to grow up and act like a man. At the next hospital, I met the urologist who explained everything to me in a calm, clinical tone ‚Äî like she could have been talking about fixing a leaky tap instead of performing surgery on one of the most fragile parts of my body. She described how they‚Äôd carve an incision down the centre and take a look inside for signs of necrosis. If it was alive and pink, they‚Äôd untwist it and tie it to the scrotum to prevent future torsions; if it was dead and black, they‚Äôd remove it. ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs in-between?‚ÄùI blurted, as I tried to haggle over my gonads like it was some sort of hostage situation.‚ÄúLike, not dead, but not exactly thriving?‚Äù She stared at me, unimpressed.‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs alive, we keep it. If it‚Äôs dead, we don‚Äôt.‚Äù For a split second, I thought about suggesting,‚ÄúWhat if we just let it heal? Maybe give it some vitamins?‚ÄùBut deep down, I knew I‚Äôd already had my chance to save it. Hanging on to a bad ball could mean losing both, and no amount of wishful thinking could change that, even if it was my favourite one. After one last round of negotiating, where I attempted to micromanage how they‚Äôd tie my man eggs to the sac, they gave me an oxygen mask and the sweet release of unconsciousness. I woke up groggy and in pain with one clear thought:Ouch, my balls. Wait ‚Äî myballs? I‚Äôd never felt happier to say that sentence to myself. The next day, as I was getting ready to leave the hospital, relieved to still have both my boy berries, a male nurse gave me one final check. His hands were massive. And yes, he manhandled my balls. It hurt. A lot. But as he squeezed and twisted my poor orbs, making sure the stitches were good, I realised something important: I‚Äôd rather be manhandled and alive than too scared to act and lose it all. I was one of the rare, extremely lucky cases. Despite delaying my trip to the hospital, I walked away with both testes intact. But not everyone is so lucky. Since my surgery, I‚Äôve spent time onforums exchanging recovery tipswith other people who‚Äôve been through this, and it‚Äôs shocking how many of them ended up losing a ball. One story stuck with me ‚Äî a 14-year-old boy who posted online that he‚Äôd been in excruciating pain for three days and couldn‚Äôt stop throwing up, asking,‚ÄúHow do I tell my parents?‚ÄùBy the time he finally sought out help, it was too late. He was lucky to keep one. It‚Äôs stories like this that remind me how close I came to losing mine and how shame has no place when your health is on the line. Whatever fear or embarrassment is keeping you from seeing a doctor, it‚Äôs not worth the risk. Trust me, if something feels off, don‚Äôt wait. Your balls deserve to be seen, touched, and manhandled.

      "{'Title': 'Self Discipline. How to quit addictions, diet, etc. | by Edburyr | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Edburyr Follow -- Listen Share How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

We‚Äôre not talking about simple tasks anymore; AI is getting morepersonal, morecreative, and even a littleemotional(yes, AI has feelings now, sort of). So buckle up, because this post is about to dive into the quirkiest, most game-changing AI trends of 2025. Let‚Äôs break it down and have some fun while we‚Äôre at it. Okay, picture this: you‚Äôre having a rough day, and your phone ‚Äî without any drama ‚Äî sends you a text that says, ‚ÄúHey, I got your back.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs not your BFF; it‚Äôs Emotional AI. Yes, AI is finally gettingin touchwith its feelings! Emotional AI? It‚Äôs like your AI bestie who knows when you need a pep talk, or maybe just a virtual hug. Generative AI was cool before, but now? Oh boy. AI 2.0 is thecreative geniuswe never knew we needed. This isn‚Äôt just about generating text; we‚Äôre talking full-on art, stories, and even movies ‚Äî no human needed. www.sequoiacap.com Generative AI is no longer the assistant; it‚Äôs thestar of the show. Just wait until you see what it can come up with next. Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî businesses love efficiency. And what‚Äôs more efficient than AI doing all the boring stuff so you can focus onbig ideas? Businesses are waking up to the power of AI, and it‚Äôstotallyreshaping the way things get done. Efficiency is the name of the game, and AI is the MVP. Hold on. While AI is doing some pretty mind-blowing things, we need to keep it in check. Ethical AI is like the parental figure saying, ‚ÄúOkay, but only if you follow the rules.‚Äù And it‚Äôs about time. Ethical AI is the safety net that ensures we use this powerful tool for good, not for‚Ä¶ you know, world domination. (But wearekeeping an eye on that).

      "{'Title': 'The Los Angeles Fires: The Indictment of the Fossil Fuel Industry | by Ken McMullen | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Ken McMullen Follow -- Listen Share ON JANUARY 21, 2025 BY PHOTOMOTOMAN IN POLITICAL EDITORIAL Share This! I am a retired Fire Chief, and former educator. For the last 30 years of my 43 year career in the fire service, I attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. It started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. That was 32 years ago. It became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. And throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, CEO‚Äôs, CAO‚Äôs, CFO‚Äôs, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. All ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. For me, my experience first began in earnest in 1989, when fires ravaged northern Manitoba, my province. I was contracted to the Provincial Government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. In my time off from being a full-time firefighter, I trained as SARTEC, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which I acquired privately by training outside the country. I also travelled throughout the North under contract. That year, fires forced the evacuation of 25,000 people across 25 communities. However in 2003, I resigned from my fire department in order to take a Fire Chief‚Äôs position in another Province. I had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in British Columbia where I had been, technically hired. That year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was 54 million dollars. By the end of the summer, the Province of British Columbia had spent 554 million dollars fighting those fires. In the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as I had already resigned my position, I took a position as the Fire Chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in Ontario, Canada in the Region of Niagara. After eight years, I found myself successfully hired as the Fire Chief for a jurisdiction in Alberta, Canada, that surrounded Calgary, Alberta. Within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Provincial Park. The fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. My attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for 150 years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. It is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over 9,000 wells drilled in 2010. I often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? I will never know, but based on what is occurring in Canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. They divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. As my contract ended, and I began a job consulting, in May 2011, a forest fire surrounding Slave Lake, Alberta, home to 7000 people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. The loss amounted to 700 million dollars. Five years later, in May 2016, Fort McMurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of 2,400 structures. The loss amounted to 3.7 billion dollars, just in insured losses. A 2017 study from MacEwan University estimated total losses were in the range of $9 billion dollars. In 2023, Canada‚Äôs most destructive year to date, there were more than 6,000 fires, and 29 mega fires, that burned 41 million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in Canada. Experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. And then this year, Jasper, Alberta, one of the jewels of Canada‚Äôs National Parks saw a fire burn 1,113 structures. None of these occurrences is normal. None of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. They are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, in Lytton, BC, another Canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. The temperatures for the last three years having exceeded 41 C. At some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in Canada in 2021 of 49.2 C or 121 F. This is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. What Does All This Have To Do With Los Angeles? This week Audie Cornish of CNN did a podcast. Her guest was Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist for NASA. His former home, which was destroyed in the Los Angeles community of Altadena, was one of the more than 12,000 homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. Peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, ‚ÄúAs a Climate Scientist, I knew it was time to leave Los Angeles,‚Äù on January 10th, in the New York Times. His personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire 14 years he had lived in Altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to Durham, North Carolina. He did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in Southern California and Nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. And this last week, he was proved right. What is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on Fox and to the incoming President of the United States, a man who hasn‚Äôt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. The problem according to Kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. Less than half of America elected the current President of the United States (49.9%), yet this ‚Äòmandate‚Äô enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. They are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. So, Where is Safe? One of Kalmus‚Äô beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. Not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, 50 years ago, is daunting. Much of what is to come, is baked into our future. Of that, there is certainty. And whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the question remains. Where is safe? Kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. Climate change is global. Obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the United States and Canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. But Ashland, North Carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. So was Lytton, British Columbia. We are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. It will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. And because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. And none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- My name is Ken McMullen. I‚Äôm a retired Director of Emergency Services and former academic.

Eileen Chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. When they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but there‚Äôs no one they can depend on. Actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. Men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. But that‚Äôs not how it is for women. They carry so much more on their shoulders. They can pick up the weight, but they can‚Äôt put it down. It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work.

By Terri Rimmer | by Terri Persico Rimmer | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': \"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Terri Persico Rimmer Follow -- Listen Share The Heart That Matters By Terri Rimmer Shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment Melody‚Äôs neighbor Samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. Fantastic! She thought. The establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. ‚ÄúYou can just give them $5, and they‚Äôll accept that, if you have it,‚Äù Samantha, who used a wheelchair, told Melody. In a few days they went to lunch there with Samantha‚Äôs granddaughter and Melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. She would be back definitely. Over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay ‚Äî or not. She found out though that they did not want her five dollars. They wanted more and made that clear. Two years prior, Melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldn‚Äôt afford to get another vehicle. Because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. She was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. A friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment Melody couldn‚Äôt do the work. Now she‚Äôd been out of a job for four years, the longest she‚Äôd ever been unemployed. Melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldn‚Äôt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. The other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but Melody‚Äôs injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. The third time Melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something Samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. She found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didn‚Äôt mind, except for this group‚Äôs attitude of entitlement. Melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. She was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. But a professional writer/former pet and house sitter also with 40 years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. Melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. And some would ask her for money which she found laughable. The owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didn‚Äôt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. He gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. This was not the person she was. Now it was Christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough she‚Äôd had over a year that she‚Äôd been on over 19 medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. The allergist had given her the answer she‚Äôd been seeking since last year regarding her condition ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt contagious, it wasn‚Äôt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. Whew! She was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. Others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed Melody. The manager took her name, and she didn‚Äôt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. She couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. No sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. ‚ÄúHi, friend,‚Äù he said insincerely. ‚ÄúYou seem like you don‚Äôt feel well.‚Äù Melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didn‚Äôt believe her. ‚ÄúWell, if you can‚Äôt get that coughing under control you can‚Äôt eat today,‚Äù he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. She thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. The woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. The manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. So, once he walked away Melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldn‚Äôt see it. ‚ÄúI know how it is,‚Äù Melody told the woman. ‚ÄúI was in a group home before.‚Äù So, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. Now Melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. As she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. ‚ÄúHonestly, it doesn‚Äôt get any better than the mission here!‚Äù spouted a customer. -- -- I have 41 years of journalism experience having written for ten newspapers, some magazines, and web sites.

Still going strong on the no-alcohol front. Stilltryingto go strong on the running front. I‚Äôm not really craving alcohol anymore, and I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm currently elliptical and can‚Äôt properly run for the time-being. My last run was a treadmill run. My knees and my hip started hurting immediately. But my stubborn ass said, ‚ÄúHaha, no‚Äù and I put on another episode of my zombie thing and kept running. Despite the pain, I can confirm that run #6 sucked quite a bit less than run #1. I was able to do my signature slow-jog for about 15 minutes before I stopped, and I only stopped because I needed water. I even started to zone out a little, and think about other things. But now, in addition to fucking up my hip, I also have pretty constant pain my knees. Since those things are all pretty important, I took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). I know PT is something I need to do because I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. However I would MUCH rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. Ugh. Or RUNNING SHOES. But I‚Äôm making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. Anyway, I now have a PT plan to help with the pain. And even though Iknowit will help me feel better, I will certainly not be excited about doing it. I‚Äôm also an instant gratification human, which is another reason that long-term projects are hard for me. I find myself rushing through writing and rushing through art projects just because I want them to bedone.I try to take shortcuts. I don‚Äôt take the time totrulycrease the origami paper, so my cranes always look wonky. I haven‚Äôt felt very inspired on the writing front lately.

      "{'Title': 'Why perfectionism is a hindrance? | by Maryam | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Maryam Follow -- Listen Share Are you also a perfectionist like me? I always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. Under too much pressure to be perfect, I was always an average student because instead of working hard, I kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. This all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. üòî I knew I had to make a change. It wasn‚Äôt an easy process, but I actively decided to find the solution. So, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that I can decide when to stop chasing for it. Learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. In this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve his/her full potential. It‚Äôs the obsession that creates the problem. We just have to know the limits! Do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know it‚Äôs probably unattainable? Why do we do this? Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit. Essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. It encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. From an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently ‚Äòperfect lives\\' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. The flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. This constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. Nobody likes failing, right? Sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. We always think like, ‚ÄúIf I aim high enough, I‚Äôll minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing‚Äù. This fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. üçÇ The problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. Impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. Furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. Excess of anything is harmful. Our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. We are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. These images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. The pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. Many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. By meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. They may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. The ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. But sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. Also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. For some\\xa0of\\xa0us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. We believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. It‚Äôs a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though it‚Äôs often based on flawed assumptions. Many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; it‚Äôs about earning approval and acceptance. -Brene Brown The pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. When we‚Äôre so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. We might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. Ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. Continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. Celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. As Alexander Pope aptly said, ‚Äúto err is human, to forgive divine‚Äù Embrace imperfection and recognize that it‚Äôs a natural part of the human experience. It also helps to reframe our definition of success. Instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. Did we learn something new? Did we overcome a challenge? Those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasn‚Äôt \"perfect.\" Ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. By embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives.

      "{'Title': 'The Silent Enemy: Why Cancer Is Smarter Than You Think | by Saad Elbekri, MD | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Saad Elbekri, MD Follow -- Listen Share Imagine you\\'re sitting in a doctor\\'s office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: \"You have cancer.\" It\\'s shocking. Every day, 60,000 people face this same unexpected reality. Most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: \"I felt perfectly healthy.\" They didn\\'t realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. I have some terrible news: You have a1 in 5 chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. But wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. But here\\'s the catch: It\\'s far more complicated than it seems. Even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting I\\'ve performed. And despite all our training and research ‚Äî doctors still don\\'t fully understand cancer. Cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. Cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. Cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body\\'s defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine\\'s biggest challenges. At its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. Depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. The real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don\\'t follow the rules. Usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body\\'s police force ‚Äî your immune system ‚Äî and removed. Even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: Now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body\\'s defences. This buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. Initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. As the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. When the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. My colleagues and I can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. Still, that\\'s precisely for situations I\\'m getting paid for, and I like it. But here\\'s where it gets tricky: Cancer cells have a unique ability ‚Äî they can take highways through your body to spread. This process is calledmetastasis. There are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: At this point, treatment becomes more complicated. Surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. Usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. Metastasis no longer means the end ‚Äî it just means the treatment needs more personalization. But the big question remains. Damage occurs when the cell\\'s DNA is altered. Cell DNA acts as the user manual for how your cell works. When that manual is damaged, the cell develops DNA mutations, which cause it to malfunction. There are two ways a cell can get damaged: Purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. It\\'s like receiving an altered manual the moment you\\'re born. Cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of DNA damage. Sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. Cancers show up much later. Bad habits usually cause this type of DNA mutation. For example (to name a few): Those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell\\'s DNA, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. Usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. But cancer cells are smarter than you think. The more damage a cell accumulates, the more its DNA gets altered. Cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. Remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. It can now: It\\'s like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. And here is how they do it. Cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body\\'s defences: Yes. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. But there\\'s an even better approach: The best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. Early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. Cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. Your health is worth it.

Every system, every environment, and everything around us requires change after a certain time.

I do not like to entertain an impulse-driven environment because then you just become an enabler, a consumer to the chaos ‚Äî noise. A lot has been happening around us, as always.

Recently, Trump announced a major boost for AI infrastructure in the United States, with private companies planning to invest up to $500 billion over the next four years. A new venture, calledStargate, is being launched by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, according to sources familiar with the deal. Leaders from these companies, including SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman, and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, are expected to join Trump at the White House to make the announcement. The partnership will begin with a $100 billion investment and start its first project ‚Äî a data center in Texas. The plan is to expand to other states over time. Other investors are expected to join, though their identities have not yet been revealed. Stargate aims to create cutting-edge infrastructure to support AI development in the U.S. While spokespeople for SoftBank and OpenAI have not commented, this massive initiative signals a strong push to position the U.S. as a leader in AI technology.

In the late 19th century, international efforts to combat diseases like cholera and yellow fever laid the groundwork for cooperation across borders. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the aftermath of World War II that global leaders recognized the need for a central organization to address health issues on a worldwide scale. TheWHOwas officially established on April 7, 1948, a date now celebrated annually as World Health Day. With 61 countries signing its constitution, the WHO marked the beginning of a unified approach to tackling global health challenges. The WHO‚Äôs vision is ambitious yet simple: ‚ÄúHealth for All.‚Äù This encapsulates its mission to ensure that all people have access to essential healthcare services without suffering financial hardship. Its objectives include: The WHO emphasizes collaboration, working with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders to achieve its goals. TheWorld Health Organization‚Äôs work spans a broad spectrum of activities aimed at improving global health. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key functions: The WHO develops guidelines and standards that influence health practices worldwide. For example, it publishes the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a critical tool for tracking and diagnosing diseases. The WHO plays a pivotal role in eradicating and controlling infectious diseases. Its notable successes include the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and its ongoing efforts to eliminate polio. The organization also leads campaigns against malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, providing funding, resources, and technical expertise. During health crises such as pandemics, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks, the WHO steps in to coordinate international responses. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO distributed over 1 billion doses of vaccines through the COVAX initiative, saving countless lives. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are leading causes of death globally. The WHO advocates for preventive measures, such as reducing tobacco use, encouraging physical activity, and promoting healthy diets. The WHO is committed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. Through programs like the Every Woman Every Child initiative, it ensures better access to prenatal care, safe childbirth, and nutrition for mothers and children. Recognizing mental health as an integral part of overall well-being, the WHO works to destigmatize mental illness and improve access to mental health services. Its global mental health action plan emphasizes the need for early intervention and support systems. One of the WHO‚Äôs most celebrated accomplishments is the eradication of smallpox. Through a coordinated vaccination campaign, the disease was officially declared eradicated in 1980, saving millions of lives. Although polio remains endemic in a few regions, the WHO‚Äôs Global Polio Eradication Initiative has brought the world closer to eradicating this crippling disease.

Treasuring thefirsttime seeing the result of his labor from whacking thick pods with a knife and piling the milky beans in a heap before drying later for shipment, an older guy, as he sat among workers, mostly in flip-flops and dingy shirts, held the unwrapped chocolate bar up to talk, basking in his moment of glory. Impatiently, their hands reached out until he mentioned his obligation as the eldest to taste what the stranger had given him. When he finally indulged himself, the sweetness immediately spread across his lips into a smile. Earlier, another laborer, prompted by a flashing notion, had shared what he thought with others, one of several comments the group associated with eating chocolate. ‚ÄúThis is why white people are so healthy.‚Äù Saving the wrapper in his pocket after passing the rest to others, the eldest there declared that he would take it home to show to his family, so proud of his discovery of chocolate, a delicacy forcenturiesin many parts of the world, especially oncecompaniespoured in enough milk and sugar to keep dentists and physicians in business, as patients succumbed to cavities and a litany of diseases from obesity. Count me as one of the many who enjoyed those delectable desires sweetened for addiction. Switching over gradually to the kind without any added sweetness took years before I got used to the taste. Even now, I chase that bitterness down with a banana or a pinch of raisins and constantly keep an eye on the scale, adjusting daily desires by the ounce, because I treasure good health. Otherwise, I‚Äôd eat up a few sizes from all the frigid temperatures that have kept me in this season. Jazzed bysnow, the most, from what I read online, since Valentine‚Äôs of 1895, Fat Tuesday came early for strollers in New Orleans, as unseemly weather shut down the city, while also giving mothers a reason to celebrate with their kids who, like that guy tasting chocolate first, smiled wide at the sight of soft mounds piling atop cars and layering lawns everywhere ‚Äî a memory imprinted forever in a treasured click for a photo album, adding to the joy from a day off from schoolwork. First times, as well as final ones, occupy a special place that we embrace more emotionally than whatever happened before or afterward ‚Äî whether in a tasted desire or prized memory. Memories of those first moments often last throughout life, adding layers of context for comparison as we mature and grow through the years. Once we add similar moments, that original impression slowly depreciates until it loses its luster, the charm of what made it precious in the first place. Eyes that once dazzled look elsewhere now at a dinner table. Instead of connecting deeply to refresh the feeling that we promised to hold on to forever, we slip into going through the motions of just another habit ‚Äî a hug without meaning more, just another piece of chocolate for our lips. Valentine‚Äôs Day, as well as a couple of other days throughout the year, particularly the annual sale of Leonidas Chocolate, usually brings on an urge for me to resist perhaps my favorite temptation for a delicacy. However, a frozen winter of singleness has one advantage going for it ‚Äî buying less processed chocolate to sprinkle in for a random occasion, especially with fewer bouquets of scented petals that wilt by the week. Despite missing out on delectable treats that whet my appetite each year, I manage to flavor bitter nibs daily and savor them with fruit to suit my taste. Consequently, I refresh an edible joy that keeps me coming back for more each day, though rather hard-pressed to remember that first taste of chocolate ever. If I reacted similarly to the man in the video after that first bite of chocolate, my impression faded quickly amid sweetness packaged on shelves easily within reach, perhaps in preparing me for a world filled with irresistible eye candy often painted on lips. This morning‚Äôs reading treasures wisdom that knows which desires mean more and which pleasures require greater self-discipline. Each day, we encounter a new opportunity to improve on the day before or just drift back to the pack of mediocrity ‚Äî that first nibble for a taste of what lies ahead or fresh snow for a memory in years to come.

In an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ‚Äî AI-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. Yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasn‚Äôt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. Many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. After all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary AI model is what attracts funding and headlines. But here‚Äôs the catch: digital health is not just about technology; it‚Äôs about people. Whether it‚Äôs convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. In fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô side of the business. To be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. A leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. However, technology alone can‚Äôt explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. It‚Äôs the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. Think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? Or one who can design a wearable but can‚Äôt address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? In digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. Technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but it‚Äôs time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code.

The dye was alreadybanned in 1990in cosmetics for causing cancer in lab rats who ingested it. Fast forward 35 years, to yesterday, when it is finally banned in food, when we knew all along it caused cancer ifeaten. It was also‚Äúrestricted‚Äùin the EU in 1994, with allowance in cocktail cherries, aka Maraschino cherries. Maraschino cherries ‚Äî a preserved, candied cherry,originally never used dye in the first place. Created in Europe, the spirit companyLuxardo(who claims ownership), released them in 1821, using alcohol and sugar as the preservative. Eventually the cherries made their way to the US and then prohibition happened. in the 1920s, a professor in Oregon created his own version using calcium salts and brine as a preservative, which removed the coloring, so he added back coloring, artificially, giving them their bright red color. This colorant was banned in the 60s for causing cancer, so manufacturers started using another artificial colorant ‚Äî Red 40, which also causes cancer and neurological issues in humans. Red 40 is still used today in Maraschino cherries and many other foods and drinks and cosmetics. Let‚Äôs review. I am going to make this short and sweet. Just like us, large organizations, governments, charities, corporations also want self preservation, but the want it for the ‚Äúorganizations‚Äù interest aka the shareholders/stakeholders. They may employ humans like you and me, but they employ them to work on their behalf. Why do humans comply? The paycheck they receive serves their own self-interests enough to make them do things they know are not benefiting others. Nothing will change until we demand it. Power is never given back, and rarely is money. If we want to take our power back, we need to take power away from entities who are not protecting us.

      "{'Title': 'Healing Humanity or Modern Eugenics? CRISPR Determines the Future of Human Evolution | by Shaelin Gorny | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Shaelin Gorny Follow -- Listen Share Imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. A world where individuals don‚Äôt spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like Huntington‚Äôs disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. A world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. This is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. But alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. A dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where CRISPR places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. While genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. In 2018,Chinese scientist He Jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to HIV, resulting in the birth of twin girls(Raposo). Globally,42.3 million people have died from HIV, yet with CRISPR, no more have to (‚ÄúHIV‚Äù). While this trial showcased gene editing‚Äôs revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.The experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(‚ÄúWhat are the Ethical Concerns‚Ä¶?‚Äù). A clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. But what happens when scientific experimentation isn‚Äôt strictly monitored? In the cases of theTuskegee Syphilis Study,Henrietta Lacks,Nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: Catastrophe. This same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of Nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. What happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? Prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them ‚Äî a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. Evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.A 2018 study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens‚Äô adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(Agha et al.). Narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. However, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. This technology could end generations of suffering.Genome mutations cause roughly 7,000 known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (‚ÄúUsing gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases‚Äù). CRISPR technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as Huntington‚Äôs disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable ‚Äîcurrent treatment costs of $2.2 million reflect the high expense of novel technologies‚Äî it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (Pagliarulo and Lucas). Unfortunately, humans won‚Äôt stop at disease eradication. If we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldn‚Äôt we? Enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. Targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. Take theCCR5-Œî32 mutation, which Chinese scientist He Jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(Sanders). This mutation prohibits HIV infection, yetincreases susceptibility to West Nile virus and leads to a 21% higher overall mortality rate(Sanders). This is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. Eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. Additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(‚ÄúAccelerating Global Access to Gene Therapies‚Äù). While disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. Enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. What may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. Such pursuits are simply indefensible. What is the true cost of progress? When ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? Well, let‚Äôs review a familiar example. What did He Jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? Prison. Reckless application of CRISPR technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. But on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? If genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist ‚Äî it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.The World Health Organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(‚ÄúHealth Ethics & Governance‚Äù). Without enforcement, these measures are futile. CRISPR holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. But if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. This isn‚Äôt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. As a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing? The choice ‚Äî and the responsibility ‚Äî belongs to all of us.

      "{'Title': \"The Silent Epidemic. Understanding Cardiodiabesity's Threat‚Ä¶ | by Luis Cisneros | Jan, 2025 | Medium\", 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Luis Cisneros Follow -- 1 Listen Share In discussions about America‚Äôs most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. Yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. This complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. It‚Äôs a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Research by Evernorth reveals a startling statistic: 93% of adults in the United States suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. This figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. The rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. Between 1999 and 2020, adult obesity rates soared from 30.5% to 41.9%. If current trends persist, half of all American adults could be classified as obese by 2030. But this is far from a superficial issue ‚Äì it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of $719 billion annually. To put this into perspective, consider Sarah, a 45-year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. Her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. Over time, she developed type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. Sarah‚Äôs story mirrors that of millions of Americans. Collectively, the costs associated with obesity ($173 billion), heart disease and stroke ($219 billion), and diabetes ($327 billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. These expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity ‚Äì making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. While individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. Social and economic factors account for 40% of health outcomes, according to public health data. These include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability ‚Äì all of which shape an individual‚Äôs ability to maintain good health. The physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (10%), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for 20% and 30%, respectively. This breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. ‚ÄúIt is better to prevent than to cure. ‚Äì Ibn Sina‚Äù The encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable ‚Äì and, in many cases, reversible. Early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. A variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. Take, for instance, the initiative led by Cigna Healthcare in partnership with Virgin Pulse. By allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. Statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. Families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. The impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. Addressing cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a moral imperative ‚Äì it‚Äôs an economic one. Companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. On a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. Much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. Healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. Integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. The stakes are enormous. Cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a set of disconnected health problems ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of American life, from families to workplaces to entire communities. This is not a challenge we can address piecemeal or delay for another generation. If we fail to act, millions will continue to face shortened lives, mounting medical bills, and preventable suffering. We‚Äôve seen what coordinated action can do in the face of major health threats like cancer or heart disease. It‚Äôs time to bring that same urgency and focus to cardiodiabesity. The longer we wait, the more lives and resources we lose to a crisis that we already know how to address. This isn‚Äôt just about statistics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about people, families, and futures that don‚Äôt have to be cut short. The responsibility to address this crisis can no longer be postponed. -- -- 1 CEO and Founder of Nudge Health Visit us atwww.mynudgehealth.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams'}\n",

Those are the people who I see as an addiction nurse. People who suffer from trauma, and pain, got into the notion of covering the pain by drinking alcohol to numb the painful memories. I had seen people become addicted to alcohol as a child as they were given regular drinks by parents, aunts, abusers, and more. A devastating cycle.

      "{'Title': 'Why Parents Should Include Their Children In Organized Sports | by Emory Menefee | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Emory Menefee Follow -- Listen Share Why Parents Should Include Their Children In Organized Sports It‚Äôs important that parents put their kids in organized sports while growing up as it has many benefits such as maintaining strong health, heightened concentration in school, as well as psychological and social benefits as they progress into adulthood. I can vouch that sports have shaped the person I am today and helped me overcome the obstacles I encountered while growing up. When my parents separated and went through the divorce process, sports were a pivotal outlet for me. It was an area of freedom and fun away from my outside life. As a young adult who has suffered from anxiety and depression since I was thirteen due to the things happening with my family, I can say without a doubt that sports saved me. Many of my fondest memories and accomplishments came from being in sports, like scoring the game winning goal with thirty-one seconds left my junior year to be crowned the league champions with my soccer team. I don‚Äôt get the best moment of my life without organized sports. For starters, physical activity helps maintain strong health. Exercising is one of the best ways to keep children in shape and to help prevent diseases and illnesses. (National Institutes of Health, 2016). Studies showed that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of injuries, different types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer, as well as reducing risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure. The American Journal of Preventive Medicine said after school physical programs have reduced obesity the most. Having your kids stay active would help reduce lower medical care as they would be healthier more often which also results in less financial burdens. As mothers and fathers, one of your main goals in life is to always keep your kids safe, and having kids in organized sports keeps your kids healthy which helps towards that goal. Kids participating in organized sports growing up have shown to translate into benefits in the learning environment. A study that followed children from kindergarten to fourth grade showed that physical activities help children to develop and improve their cognitive skills. It has been associated with children getting better grades and doing better on standardized tests. Physical activity has also been shown to improve attitudes and academic behavior including ‚Äúenhanced concentration and attention‚Äù (GAO, 2012). Sports have always motivated me to have higher concentration in my academics to make sure I maintained solid grades. My parents would not allow me to participate in my sports if my grades weren‚Äôt good. That extra incentive while growing up helped me especially in middle school to stay focused and committed to getting good grades. Those good grades alongside sports helped me get admitted into a selective prep high school. Studies on the high school age group showed that teenagers who participated in sports are more likely to attend college and get degrees than non-athletes. Studies have shown that sports can have beneficial effects on individuals even into their adulthoods, which explained that the benefits extend into the workplace. A survey of 400 female corporate executives found that 94% played a sport growing up and 61% said it beneficially impacted their career success. (EY Women Athletes Business Network/espnW, 2014). Additionally, physical activity has also been proven to have a positive impact on mental health and social skills. Kids who are involved in physical activity have reported to have more excitement, more happiness and motivation in their day to day lives, whereas kids who are inactive reported greater nervousness, anxiety, depression, and worry. Physical activity has been shown to boost self-esteem, leadership, and goal-setting skills. A 2019 study found that children who reported to have no physical activity in their life were twice as likely to have mental health issues. According to the United Nations, sports have been proven to provide a safe environment and community for many participants. They may be having trouble at school or having issues at home. Organized sports have helped kids find an outlet from their everyday lives. It helps unite these kids to learn how to work together in a manner that also teaches them to learn the value of teamwork and respect. Additionally, it helps teach children at a young age to develop a passion for something. I fell in love with soccer and basketball when I was three. I developed many of the friendships and relationships I hold dear to this day. The community I fostered at a young age never faltered. I still reach out to old coaches I have had in the past for advice and guidance. I still keep in touch with old teammates and all of us wish each other success and happiness whenever we see one another accomplishing the goals we set when we were younger. I acknowledge that organized sports as the years progress the cost to participate also increases. There‚Äôs a fee for equipment, travel cost, hotel and food. My parents paid for me to play club soccer from age ten to eighteen. Countless practices and games. Many tournaments required us to travel to different states. Different jerseys, shorts, and socks each and every year. I agree that it can add up. When I spoke to my parents, I had asked them if they regretted any of it and they said no. They were just proud of where their daughter is today.

You try to rest, to let go, but the moment you close your eyes, the thoughts come rushing in.Did I do enough today? Did I say the right thing? What about tomorrow?It‚Äôs like trying to swim in quicksand ‚Äî the harder you fight, the deeper you sink. Rest isn‚Äôt just lying down; it‚Äôs surrendering, and for some of us, surrender feels dangerous. The silence of stillness can be deafening, amplifying all the doubts and fears we‚Äôve spent the day trying to drown out. We tell ourselves we‚Äôll rest later, after we‚Äôve done more, fixed more, achieved more. But later never comes, and the exhaustion grows, until even the idea of rest feels impossible. Somewhere along the way, we learned to equate rest with laziness, with failure.If you stop, you‚Äôll fall behind.If you rest, you‚Äôre weak.These lies become our truth, and we wear our exhaustion like a badge of honor, proof that we‚Äôre working hard, trying hard, living hard. But deep down, we know the truth: we‚Äôre breaking. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôve convinced yourself that your worth is tied to how much you do, how much you give, how much you endure. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôre afraid of what might surface in the quiet ‚Äî the fears you‚Äôve buried, the grief you‚Äôve ignored, the parts of yourself you‚Äôve been too scared to face. Just like your heart needs a beat of silence between every pulse, you need moments to pause, to breathe, to simply exist without expectation. Rest isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness; it‚Äôs an act of courage. It‚Äôs saying,I choose to care for myself, even when the world tells me I shouldn‚Äôt. And yes, it‚Äôs terrifying. Slowing down feels like losing control. But control is an illusion anyway. The world will keep spinning whether you‚Äôre running yourself into the ground or taking a moment to recover. The difference is, when you choose rest, you give yourself a chance to heal, to rebuild, to carry on without breaking completely. So, if you feel like you can‚Äôt stop ‚Äî stop anyway. Not forever, not all at once, but for a moment. Let the world wait. Let the guilt scream and the doubts whisper. Sit with them. Breathe through them. And remind yourself of this truth:you are not your productivity. Your value isn‚Äôt measured by how much you give to others but by the fact that you are here, alive, trying. Even if rest feels impossible now, it‚Äôs not. Start small ‚Äî a breath, a pause, a moment of stillness. You deserve to be whole, not just what‚Äôs left after everyone else has taken their share. You deserve peace, even when the world doesn‚Äôt offer it freely. And most of all, you deserve rest ‚Äî because you‚Äôve carried enough for today. -- -- Navigating mental health, and something about growth.

Karty | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in M. E. Karty Follow -- Listen Share Below is an unanswered, unacknowledged email I sent about my foodborne botulism case to a journalist in Indianapolis, Indiana . I almost died of food poisoning, was paralyzed and on a ventilator of two months, and it doesn‚Äôt make the paper? No news outlets? Not even a blogpost? Are you kidding me? I am just now healthy enough to write about it. I am not going to shut up about it, because food safety will only get worse under this next administration. Until I am dead, I will not be silenced. Hello Ms. Xxxxxx, I received your information from Xssss Xssssssss, a colleague of yours. He thought you would be the person to direct this story. On August 5th, 2024, my husband and I contracted foodborne botulism. After a night of violent vomiting and other gastrointestinal distress, things turned worse. Within hours, I lost the use of my legs and had shortness of breath. My husband was vomiting as well and had double vision and we were both slurring our words. Something deathly was wrong. We called my brother-in-law, a hospitalist MD out of Xxxxxxx, and he said to go to the emergency room immediately. My father-in-law from Xxxxxxx happened to be in the area visiting his sister and took my husband to Community North. We called an ambulance for me because I couldn‚Äôt move and was gasping for air. We believe we were diagnosed with botulism in a timely manner because we went in together. By all looks of things, my husband, a fifty-year-old, looked like he was having a stroke. What we conjecture is that his symptoms along with my descending paralysis from the head down was how they caught it. By then, the paralysis had reached my diaphragm and I could no longer breathe on my own. By the Grace of God and excellent medical care, a doctor recognized our combined symptoms as botulism. There is a test for botulism, and that takes four days. I think without intervention, I would have been dead within hours. The doctor called the CDC and an anti-toxin was flown in from Chicago. The anti-toxin was administered, and we lived. My husband left the hospital, walking with a cane breathing on his own, in three weeks. My exposure must have been more extreme because I was a lot sicker. After two days of struggling to breath, I was intubated after what can only be categorized as a near death experience. I later had a tracheostomy and breathed through a tube in my neck for eight weeks. It took me a full twelve weeks to recover from the paralysis to walk and talk again. It has been five months, and I still have to walk with a walker. That is one heck of a story, right? So why is our case on the CDC or Indiana Health Department‚Äôs website? I called the Indiana Health Department and they said there has to be at least ten cases in order for it to be worthy of public record. Two cases of botulism are two cases too many. I understand because of HIPPA, that my anonymity is paramount, but so is public health. I am willing to out myself to bring attention to this deadly, but treatable disease. Yes, botulism is rare and only deadly in five percent of cases, if it is caught in time. Many of my doctors and nurses said they haven‚Äôt seen a botulism case in twenty years. That doesn‚Äôt mean that there were unreported botulism because it was not diagnosed in time. Undiagnosed botulism looks like heart failure or unexplained pnemonia. I was lucky and healthy enough to recover. I was lucky to have insurance and to live in Indianapolis with access to top notch health centers like Community North and Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana (RHI). I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to have the forty pounds to lose in two months. I had no underlying conditions. You change one factor, and I‚Äôm dead of suffocation or heart failure in the first twenty-four hours, or I‚Äôm dead of pneumonia in two weeks. I am a miracle of luck and medical science, and no one outside of my inner circle knows about it. I want everyone to know about it. Our food supply chain is already shaky because of monopolies, and I fear with the incoming administration and the overturning of the Chevron decision that essentially weakened Federal agencies, such as the FDA, things will get worse. If my ordeal can make a difference, I am willing to forgo my anonymity for healthcare providers, legislators, and the public to know how to protect themselves when dinner turns deadly. I am looking forward to speaking with you. Sincerely, M*** K***** Botulism Survivor -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams'}\n",
      "{'Title': 'Sit-to-Stand Desks: a Small Change for a Big Impact | by Margaret Fennebresque | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Margaret Fennebresque Follow -- Listen Share With around ‚Öì of the child population overweight or obese and 40% unable to read at a basic level, I think we can all agree that good health and academic optimization are two things America needs more of (Fiorenzi;Literacy Statistics 2022‚Äì2023). What if I were to tell you that there is a simple action that American schools can take that addresses both health complications and academic hardships? Well, I hope you‚Äôre on the edge of your seat because I want you to get out of it. That‚Äôs right‚Äì stand up, as my research has led me to believe that the solution is standing! American schools should transition to sit-to-stand desks to take advantage of the plethora of benefits to standing instead of sitting, ranging from hindering health issues like diabetes and ADHD to cultivating academic success by improving mood and averting hours of unproductivity. Tens of thousands of hours of every American‚Äôs life is spent at school, and 65‚Äì70% of this time is spent sitting down (Leech;Prepwise).Sitting is the new smoking, you might have heard, and this claim is backed by findings linking health complications such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease to sedentary time (Fiorenzi). Fortunately, standing desks, being on the path to movement, aids in combating each of such complications. Standing burns more calories than sitting, averaging an additional 50 calories per hour in adults, and studies have shown that obese or overweight children burn even more than their healthy-weight peers (Fiorenzi). Standing has been found to reduce blood sugar spikes after meals, a benefit especially helpful for diabetics but good for everyone since ‚Äúgreater amplitudes of glycemic variability have been linked to circulatory oxidative stress‚Äù (Jubbal). Standing is also connected with better heart health, as a study consisting of sitting and standing bus drivers observed that the standing drivers‚Äô risk for heart disease was half of that of the sitting drivers (Leech). If standing were to become the social norm, both the physiological perks and a new social pressure to be healthy enough to stand for longer periods would hinder health complications in the American school population. Consistent with the correlation between better health and academic achievement, sit-to-stand desks provide users with a better learning experience by optimizing key factors to academic success, including productivity, mood, and attention (Kurniawan;Schmidt;Valiente). One of the more obvious perks of a standing desk is postural improvement; good posture naturally reduces back, neck and sciatica pain (Leech). According to astudy, patients suffering from chronic pain had an average reduction of 9.8 hours of work productivity per week. I‚Äôm not sure about you, but I can learn quite a lot in almost 10 hours. A lesser known perk of a standing desk is its effect on mood: a positive one to be more specific. In one study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue and 87% reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day and after returning to sitting desks their moods reverted to their original levels (Leech). This study complements other research finding sitting and sedentary lifestyles linked with increased risks of depression and anxiety (Leech). As a student, I can attest that maintaining a positive outlook has pushed me to take risks that have led to my own academic success. Although you might have expected that standing desks would create distraction for children, I have found far more evidence suggesting just the opposite. I acknowledge that there is some anecdotal evidence documenting young children bumping into one another while using standing desks, however, recall that chairs create similar distractions including rocking, footsie, and leg swinging (‚ÄúThe Effects of Standing Desks‚Äù). On the other hand, one study demonstrated that students using standing desks exhibited ‚Äúsignificant improvements in attention and inhibitory control compared to their sitting peers,‚Äù and schoolchildren in the experiment group of another study that used standing-desks were found to be between 12 and 25% more engaged than the control group (Fiorenzi;Otto). Dr. Mark Benden of Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health explains this finding well: ‚ÄúWhen kids sit at a desk all day, they don‚Äôt have to use any energy, which means they can just as easily fall asleep, daydream, or distract themselves by distracting others‚Äù (Fiorenzi). At least for me, it ismuchharder to fall asleep standing up. Considering that standing expends more energy than sitting, it‚Äôs logical that distraction would be reduced, a boon particularly for millions of American children diagnosed with ADD or ADHD (Fiorenzi). Hopefully at this point, you‚Äôre convinced that standing desks have immense benefits. You may still be wondering, though, is it worth the effort to replace all sitting desks with standing desks? Allow me to clarify what I mean by ‚Äútransitioning to sit-to-stand desks.‚Äù It‚Äôd be a waste to toss out perfectly adequate sitting desks already owned, but I do think that when schools are in the market for new desks, they should purchase sit-to-stand desks. Sit-to-stand desks allow users to adjust the height of the desk, giving them the option to sit or stand, thereby taking into consideration the needs of physically disabled children and providing flexibility for various activities. Lastly, whereas the monetary price of sit-to-stand desks might be slightly more than that of a sitting-only desk, having the ability to make use of the numerous, substantial advantages of standing sure seem to outweigh that small cost differential. If you believe in having a healthy, educated population, I urge you to use your influence as a student, parent, teacher, staff member, administrator, or alumni to advocate for sit-to-stand desks in your school.

But researchers aren‚Äôt just focused on adding years ‚Äî they‚Äôre looking to extend health alongside lifespan. A recent study offers a glimpse into what may be possible: combining two FDA-approved drugs,trametinibandrapamycin, resulted in a significant lifespan increase in mice, while also improving their health in old age. Researchers gave one group of mice trametinib, another group rapamycin, and a third group a combination of the two. The results were striking: ‚Ä¢Trametinib aloneextended median lifespan by7%‚Äì10%, depending on sex. ‚Ä¢Rapamycin aloneincreased lifespan by17%‚Äì18%. ‚Ä¢ Thecombination of both drugsshowed the most dramatic effects, boosting lifespan by35% in femalesand27% in males. What‚Äôs more, the maximum lifespan (the longest any mice lived) increased significantly when both drugs were used together, highlighting their additive benefits. Both drugs target different cellular pathways involved in aging: ‚Ä¢Trametinibworks on a pathway that regulates cell growth. ‚Ä¢Rapamycininhibits a pathway linked to inflammation and age-related diseases. By combining these mechanisms, the drugs created a stronger anti-aging effect than either could achieve alone. Extending lifespan is one thing, but how did the micefeelas they aged? Researchers found the drug combo also improved key markers of health: ‚Ä¢Heart health:Delayed age-related decline in heart function. ‚Ä¢Tumors:Reduced tumor growth and overall tumor load. ‚Ä¢Inflammation:Lowered inflammation in the brain and body. However, it wasn‚Äôt all good news. Some mice experienced side effects like fatty liver disease and testicular degeneration, raising questions about how these drugs might work in humans. Both trametinib and rapamycin are FDA-approved, but for very different uses: ‚Ä¢Trametinibtreats certain types of cancer. ‚Ä¢Rapamycinis used after organ transplants to prevent rejection. The fact that these drugs are already approved opens the door for further research into their potential as longevity treatments. However, what works in mice doesn‚Äôt always translate to humans. Animal studies like this are an exciting starting point, but testing in humans could take decades. Scientists are now exploring whether combining even more drugs ‚Äî like diabetes medications metformin and acarbose ‚Äî could create an even stronger anti-aging effect. The goal is to target multiple cellular pathways to not only extend lifespan but also reduce age-related diseases. But before you get too excited, remember: it‚Äôs still early days. While these findings are promising, the path from lab to human trials is long and full of challenges. This study highlights the potential of drug combinations to unlock new frontiers in longevity research.

I saw fruit with bright orange skin and slightly porous texture. Oranges. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like eating this fruit, but when I eat oranges, my hands will feel sticky and sometimes the aroma will linger on my hands for a long time. Every time I was offered oranges, I always argued, later. Later I will eat them, later I will finish them.Later, I said. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt know that citrus fruits can boost the immune system, avoiding colds. But it turns out that citrus fruits have more benefits than that, such as can improve digestion because it contains fiber, can prevent many diseases such as cancer, heart, kidney and even reduce the frequency of asthma attacks because it is anti-inflammatory. OK! Reading those benefits all sound very good. But how long can I eat this much citrus fruit. Unlike the needs of children under 15 years old who only need 50‚Äì65 mg per day. An adult like me needs 75‚Äì90mg of vitamin C intake per day in a fit condition. And one medium-sized orange contains approximately 70mg of vitamin C. Well, that‚Äôs enough for me. One orange a day. The more I search, the more I read. In fact, this fruit can easily be found all over the world. But what if I can‚Äôt find this fruit in some season. The research continues lead me to alternatives. I was suprised to find a guava fruit that has more than 126mg, rich in antioxidants and equal in one fruit. Wow. Apart from guava, papaya and strawberries can be other options that both contain antioxidants that help maintain brain health and flavonoids that are believed to prevent cancer and heart disease. Mangoes are also high in vitamin C, while guavas also contain vitamin A, which has been shown to boost the immune system and eye health. At the end of the research, I was glad.

He claims that rigorous studies have proved it to increase weight loss by 200%‚Ä¶ Incredible, right? And how helpful of him to include an Amazon affiliate link where you can buy the tea‚Ä¶ Well, since Meta recently announced that they‚Äôll be removing fact-checking from its platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Threads), you‚Äôre left with the question of how you‚Äôll determine if the miracle tea is a hoax with fabricated statistics or a genuine scientific discovery. In Meta‚Äôs press video, CEO Mark Zuckerberg justifies the decision by saying that fact-checkers were too politically biased, and were making too many false positives ‚Äî taking down posts that didn‚Äôt spread erroneous facts. Additionally, he believes this is a step toward supporting free speech, supposedly a Meta and American value. Whether we resonate with Meta‚Äôs decision or not, those of us who work in healthcare, or merely care about our health, are left wondering where we‚Äôll get our health information from. According to a survey by the National Library of Medicine, 85% of people seek health information using social media, including WhatsApp, YouTube, and Facebook. Although the survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia, it can likely be generalized to most places, since we‚Äôre increasingly chronically online globally. This means we have to be extra cautious about the health information we share and consume online. Without the help of fact-checkers, how can you separate fact from fiction? If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Health improvements take time, consistency, and evidence-based methods. 2.

AtNutrix AI, we‚Äôre building a platform with evidence-based and easy-to-understand nutrition advice. 3.

Then almost as an afterthought, she added:‚Äú‚Ä¶that is, if you get to keep them both.‚Äù Before you jump to any conclusions,I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.I didn‚Äôt take a hit to the groin, try a weird yoga pose, or do anything unusual in the bedroom. It was a normal sunny morning, full of possibilities until it was obliterated by a sudden pain in my left testicle. At first, it was just a twinge, but every time I moved, it got worse. Still, it wasn‚Äôt agony. Definitely not‚Äúrush to the hospital‚Äùterritory. Besides, I had plans. It was a big New Year‚Äôs Eve bash and nothing was going to ruin that. Except, of course, my balls. In the end, the pain became impossible to ignore, and I had to tell my friends I couldn‚Äôt make it out. Luckily, they were supportive and one of them sent me a medical helpline number and told me to call. Naturally, like anyone in need of an expert‚Äôs opinion, I turned to Google. Testicular torsion ‚Äî a condition where the spermatic cord twists, cutting off blood flow to the testicle ‚Äî kept appearing with urgent warnings to act within six hours. But I‚Äôd been in pain all day so I was‚Äútechnically‚Äùsafe. But that wasn‚Äôt the real reason I didn‚Äôt call right away‚Ä¶ The truth is, I have small, some might say (not me) ladylike hands. And I couldn‚Äôt stop picturing dropping my pants and having my dynamic duo manhandled by some ogre of a man‚Äôs giant hands, like a gorilla fumbling with cherries. So, I made the crucial mistake of sleeping on it.‚ÄúIf it still hurts in the morning,‚ÄùI decided,‚Äúthen I‚Äôll call the number.‚Äù So, after a night of very little sleep and multiple testicle-related nightmares, I dialed the helpline. The medical questions came fast, and I was nailing them.‚ÄúNo,‚ÄùI said confidently (and truthfully) to everything: swelling?No.Fever?Nope.The wrong colour?God, no. I was breezing through their questions, and by the time they‚Äôd finished, I felt like I‚Äôd just aced a maths test. ‚ÄúAre you alone?‚Äùthe lady asked, breaking my self-congratulatory haze.‚ÄúI‚Äôm with my parents,‚ÄùI replied.‚ÄúGood, because you need to get to the hospital immediately!‚ÄùMy stomach sank as she delivered the bombshell diagnosis:‚ÄúIt might be testicular torsion.‚Äù As I sat in the car, panic rising in my chest, I couldn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd let something as stupid as my fear of big hands keep me from getting help sooner. Would I really rather lose a ball than let a big-handed man touch me? Apparently, yes. And now I wondered if my hesitation had cost me everything. At the hospital, I found some small comfort in the fact that, so far, only women had been tasked with examining my precious cargo. First, a kind nurse asked a few questions, then a calm technician performed an ultrasound ‚Äî no sign of any gorilla-handed ogre-men. But then the results came back.‚ÄúYou need to get to another hospital,‚Äùthey said.‚ÄúNow.‚Äù Suddenly, I was in an ambulance, sirens blaring, racing toward a urologist who would decide the fate of my crown jewels. That‚Äôs when it hit me: this wasn‚Äôt a joke, and my balls weren‚Äôt going to wait for me to grow up and act like a man. At the next hospital, I met the urologist who explained everything to me in a calm, clinical tone ‚Äî like she could have been talking about fixing a leaky tap instead of performing surgery on one of the most fragile parts of my body. She described how they‚Äôd carve an incision down the centre and take a look inside for signs of necrosis. If it was alive and pink, they‚Äôd untwist it and tie it to the scrotum to prevent future torsions; if it was dead and black, they‚Äôd remove it. ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs in-between?‚ÄùI blurted, as I tried to haggle over my gonads like it was some sort of hostage situation.‚ÄúLike, not dead, but not exactly thriving?‚Äù She stared at me, unimpressed.‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs alive, we keep it. If it‚Äôs dead, we don‚Äôt.‚Äù For a split second, I thought about suggesting,‚ÄúWhat if we just let it heal? Maybe give it some vitamins?‚ÄùBut deep down, I knew I‚Äôd already had my chance to save it. Hanging on to a bad ball could mean losing both, and no amount of wishful thinking could change that, even if it was my favourite one. After one last round of negotiating, where I attempted to micromanage how they‚Äôd tie my man eggs to the sac, they gave me an oxygen mask and the sweet release of unconsciousness. I woke up groggy and in pain with one clear thought:Ouch, my balls. Wait ‚Äî myballs? I‚Äôd never felt happier to say that sentence to myself. The next day, as I was getting ready to leave the hospital, relieved to still have both my boy berries, a male nurse gave me one final check. His hands were massive. And yes, he manhandled my balls. It hurt. A lot. But as he squeezed and twisted my poor orbs, making sure the stitches were good, I realised something important: I‚Äôd rather be manhandled and alive than too scared to act and lose it all. I was one of the rare, extremely lucky cases. Despite delaying my trip to the hospital, I walked away with both testes intact. But not everyone is so lucky. Since my surgery, I‚Äôve spent time onforums exchanging recovery tipswith other people who‚Äôve been through this, and it‚Äôs shocking how many of them ended up losing a ball. One story stuck with me ‚Äî a 14-year-old boy who posted online that he‚Äôd been in excruciating pain for three days and couldn‚Äôt stop throwing up, asking,‚ÄúHow do I tell my parents?‚ÄùBy the time he finally sought out help, it was too late. He was lucky to keep one. It‚Äôs stories like this that remind me how close I came to losing mine and how shame has no place when your health is on the line. Whatever fear or embarrassment is keeping you from seeing a doctor, it‚Äôs not worth the risk. Trust me, if something feels off, don‚Äôt wait. Your balls deserve to be seen, touched, and manhandled.

Follow Crow‚Äôs Feet: Life As We Age -- Share Some days make you feel like you should buy a lottery ticket, thanks to coincidences that leave you asking, ‚ÄúWhat are the odds?‚Äù Today was one of those days. I had my blood drawn for an annual study I‚Äôve been participating in since 2017. The study aims to determine if specific markers can help detect ovarian cancer earlier in its progression. Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in women and the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers, according to theAmerican Cancer Society. About half of the women with ovarian cancer are 63 or older. Unlike other gynecologic cancers, such as cervical cancer and breast cancer, which have routine screenings like Pap smears and mammograms, ovarian cancer often isn‚Äôt detected until it has advanced, usually by stage III or IV. And it can only be confirmed through a tissue biopsy. Although it‚Äôs a rare cancer, its aggressive nature makes early detection critical.

Their hearts beat in rhythm, as if they were always meant to find each other, to intertwine in a way that nothing, not even time, could undo. For him, a skeptic of anything unseen, and for her, a believer in something beyond the veil, their love was a fragile bridge between two worlds. It was beautiful, but it was also doomed. She wore her faith like a sacred mantle, each prayer, each word, a thread that tied her to her heritage, her family, her God. He, with his agnostic heart, questioned everything, trusting only in what he could see and touch. Yet, in each other‚Äôs presence, they found a connection deeper than the constructs of religion. Their souls recognized one another, something ancient and undeniable, a love that transcended labels and boundaries. But the world they lived in would not let them exist in peace. Her parents whispered in hushed tones, their disapproval a cold, unspoken wall between them. His family, though silent, carried a quiet distance, unable to understand the gravity of a love they deemed impossible. They both knew the truth ‚Äî religion, that sacred force, was the unyielding barrier between them. No matter how deep their feelings, no matter how tender the moments shared, faith would always come first. In the end, love was not enough. They parted, hearts breaking under the weight of what could never be. She prayed for peace; he, for understanding. Yet, neither could escape the excruciating pain of a love that was born to die, a love crushed beneath the weight of faith‚Äôs unrelenting hand. The days after their parting felt like a hollow echo, each moment stretching longer than the last. She would close her eyes and see him, his face etched in the canvas of her memories ‚Äî his smile, the way he held her hand like it was the only thing keeping him grounded. And in those fleeting seconds of nostalgia, the weight of their separation would hit her like a physical blow. She would inhale deeply, hoping the scent of his presence would linger in the air, but it was gone, erased by the rigid walls of tradition and faith that both of them had tried so desperately to climb. For him, the emptiness was no less consuming. He wandered through his days in a fog, every corner of his world now devoid of the warmth she once brought. He questioned everything more now than ever before ‚Äî his beliefs, his doubts, his reality. Was there a God? Was there something greater than this aching void that had taken root in his chest? He could almost feel her ‚Äî her spirit, her soul ‚Äî out there, just beyond his reach. But faith, that ancient force that governed her life and so many others, had come crashing down between them, an insurmountable divide. What hurt the most was the silence that followed their love. It wasn‚Äôt just the absence of her voice or the void where her laughter used to echo. It was the silence of understanding lost, the quiet acknowledgment that what they had wasn‚Äôt enough, not in this world where love and faith couldn‚Äôt coexist without causing a fracture. They had tried ‚Äî oh, how they had tried ‚Äî to find a way. She had hoped that love would bridge the gap, that the raw purity of their connection might challenge the chains of doctrine that bound them. But love wasn‚Äôt enough when the very core of who they were ‚Äî her belief in a higher power and his rejection of it ‚Äî was in direct opposition. She would often catch herself staring at the stars, the same stars that once shone above them both in those stolen moments of joy. The night sky used to feel infinite, a reflection of the boundless love they shared. But now, it was just a reminder of the distance between them, a cruel reflection of the space that had grown between their hearts. In the dark, quiet spaces of the night, he too would look up, seeing only the expanse of the universe, but it felt colder somehow. It felt empty. Love, he thought, shouldn‚Äôt feel like this. It should have been enough. She should have been enough. But how could she be, when everything she held dear was anathema to everything he had come to believe? How could she understand his doubts, the gnawing questions that had no answers, when she was so firmly anchored in a faith he could never share? They had loved with a passion that knew no bounds, but now that same love felt like a cruel, unfulfilled promise. What was the point of all their whispers, their stolen kisses, their shared dreams, when in the end, they were destined to part, unable to break free from the invisible chains that bound them? The pain of that separation would stay with them forever, a scar that would never fully heal. Because sometimes, love is not enough ‚Äî not when the world demands that you choose between your heart and your soul. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams'}\n",

      "{'Title': 'I Drank Turmeric, Lemon, And Hot Water for 30 Days ‚Äì This is What Happened | by Health Remedies | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': \"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Health Remedies Follow -- Listen Share As someone with 15 years of experience in the health field, I‚Äôve seen countless trends come and go. But there‚Äôs one simple ritual that has truly stood the test of time and has had a profound effect on my health: drinking warm water with turmeric and lemon first thing in the morning. It‚Äôs a combination that many might overlook, but I can tell you from personal experience that this powerful drink has had remarkable effects on my body. It‚Äôs not just about health‚Äîit‚Äôs about feeling energized, clear-headed, and vibrant throughout the day. I will fully explain how I prepare this amazing drink, for maximum effectiveness later below in this article Let me take you through the incredible transformations I‚Äôve experienced, and why I believe you should consider adding this to your daily routine. We all want clear, healthy skin, but what we often forget is that true radiance comes from the inside out. When I first started incorporating turmeric and lemon into my daily routine, I didn‚Äôt expect to see such a noticeable difference in my skin. It wasn‚Äôt just about reducing wrinkles or improving tone‚Äîit was about feeling like my skin was nourished from the inside. Now, almost every morning, as soon as I finish my warm drink, I feel a subtle shift, like my skin is thanking me. Turmeric‚Äôs Healing Touch Turmeric, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, has been a game-changer for my complexion. The active ingredient, curcumin, is a powerhouse of antioxidants, which help protect the skin from the inside. Over time, I noticed fewer breakouts and a significant reduction in redness. As a woman in her mid 30s, I‚Äôve struggled with occasional flare-ups, especially around hormonal changes. But since drinking turmeric regularly, those flare-ups have become much less frequent. I now have smoother skin, fewer blemishes, and it looks much more even. The reduction in redness, especially around my cheeks and chin, has been remarkable. I used to use heavy foundations to hide these blemishes, but now I feel comfortable going makeup-free and just letting my skin breathe. The turmeric not only works to reduce inflammation but also enhances the natural healing process of the skin. If you‚Äôre someone who struggles with conditions like acne or eczema, you‚Äôll understand the struggle of trying various treatments, but trust me when I say that turmeric is a natural, non-invasive solution. Lemon‚Äôs Collagen Boost Then there's the lemon‚Äîrich in vitamin C, which plays a crucial role in collagen production. As we age, our bodies naturally produce less collagen, which leads to sagging skin and wrinkles. However, by drinking lemon water, I‚Äôve found that my skin appears firmer and more youthful. It‚Äôs as if the lemon is helping restore the firmness and elasticity that I noticed was starting to fade. Vitamin C not only boosts collagen but also fights free radicals that cause premature aging. For example, I started seeing fewer fine lines around my eyes and mouth. I have to admit, I‚Äôve noticed that my skin‚Äôs natural glow has returned, and my friends often ask me what my secret is. The combination of turmeric and lemon has given me the radiant, youthful skin I thought I could only achieve through expensive skincare products. As someone who has experienced the highs and lows of different diets and detox programs, I‚Äôve always believed in the power of simple, natural solutions. When I began drinking turmeric and lemon water every morning, it became a ritual that not only helped my skin but also had a positive impact on my entire body. I noticed how light and refreshed I felt, almost like my body had been gently ‚Äúreset.‚Äù This is where the magic of detoxification comes in. Turmeric and Liver Health The liver is your body's detox powerhouse, and turmeric has been shown to support its function. As we age, or even just due to everyday stress, toxins can build up in our bodies. In my experience, turmeric has been a great help in supporting the liver‚Äôs ability to break down these toxins. With the addition of this drink, I felt like my body was able to detoxify more effectively. I no longer felt sluggish or bogged down by the toxic load that sometimes accumulates. Instead, I felt lighter, more energized, and ready to tackle the day. For example, after a long weekend of indulging in rich foods or alcohol, I‚Äôd sometimes wake up feeling bloated and sluggish. Drinking turmeric and lemon water was like pressing the ‚Äúreset‚Äù button for my system. It helped ease bloating and improve digestion, something I‚Äôve truly appreciated. Lemon‚Äôs Role in the Detox Process Lemon, with its high vitamin C and antioxidant content, adds another layer of detox benefits. Lemon helps alkalize the body, supporting the natural processes of detoxification. Over time, I noticed that I wasn‚Äôt just feeling better overall‚ÄîI was eliminating toxins more efficiently, leading to improved digestion and fewer digestive issues. Bloating and uncomfortable fullness, which I used to experience after large meals, became a thing of the past. I felt much lighter, as though my digestive system had been given the support it needed to function at its best. As someone who‚Äôs been active in sports and fitness throughout my life, I‚Äôve had my fair share of joint pain, especially as I‚Äôve gotten older. I first turned to turmeric for its renowned anti-inflammatory properties, and I‚Äôve been amazed at how much it‚Äôs helped with joint pain. After just a few weeks of incorporating turmeric and lemon into my routine, I started feeling a noticeable reduction in discomfort and stiffness, particularly in my knees and lower back. Turmeric‚Äôs Anti-Inflammatory Benefits Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, works by reducing inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation is one of the leading causes of joint pain, especially in conditions like arthritis. As I drank my warm turmeric and lemon water every morning, I began to notice that my joints weren‚Äôt as stiff when I woke up. In the past, I used to struggle to get out of bed without a few creaky moments, but that‚Äôs no longer the case. There was a time when I would have to warm up slowly before any workout or even a simple walk. Now, I don‚Äôt feel the same stiffness, and I‚Äôm able to move more freely. My joint pain has been significantly reduced, and even my posture has improved because I don‚Äôt have that constant discomfort weighing me down. Lemon‚Äôs Contribution to Joint Health Lemon‚Äôs role in improving joint health is also significant. Its high vitamin C content supports collagen production, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of cartilage in the joints. As I continued with this daily routine, I noticed that not only did my joints feel better, but I was also less prone to injury. Collagen plays a vital role in joint flexibility, and drinking lemon water regularly helped me maintain that flexibility as I got older. In addition to all of the benefits I've already discussed, one of the most impactful changes I‚Äôve noticed since drinking turmeric and lemon water every morning is a strengthened immune system. As a health expert, I understand how crucial it is to support the immune system, especially in today‚Äôs world where stress and environmental toxins can weaken it over time. The combination of turmeric and lemon provides a powerful boost to your body‚Äôs defenses. Turmeric and Immune Support Turmeric‚Äôs anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties help reduce the strain on your immune system, allowing it to work more efficiently. I‚Äôve noticed that since I started this daily ritual, I‚Äôve had fewer colds and felt more resilient when the flu season came around. It wasn‚Äôt just about preventing illness; it was about feeling more in tune with my body and less vulnerable to external stressors. Lemon‚Äôs Antioxidants Lemon, with its high vitamin C, is another essential part of this immunity-boosting duo. Vitamin C is known for supporting the production of white blood cells, which are crucial for fighting off infections. Over the years, I‚Äôve found that my body‚Äôs ability to fend off colds and viruses has significantly improved. I rarely get sick, and when I do, I recover much faster than I used to. The combined antioxidant power of turmeric and lemon makes this morning drink a must for anyone looking to stay healthy. Another unexpected benefit of drinking turmeric and lemon water first thing in the morning is improved digestion. For years, I struggled with occasional bloating and digestive discomfort. But since incorporating this drink into my daily routine, I‚Äôve found that my digestion has become smoother and more efficient. This, in turn, has had a positive impact on my overall weight management. Turmeric‚Äôs Digestive Benefits Turmeric has long been used to soothe the digestive system. It has natural carnation properties, which means it helps to reduce bloating and gas. For someone who has had issues with bloating after meals, this drink has been a lifesaver. It has calmed my stomach and helped promote regular, healthy digestion. Lemon‚Äôs Digestive Boost Lemon also plays a significant role in digestion. Its acidic nature helps stimulate the production of bile, which aids in breaking down fats and improving overall digestion. After incorporating lemon into my morning routine, I noticed that I no longer felt weighed down after meals. Instead, I felt light and energized, which made a big difference in my overall health and weight management journey. I even started noticing subtle changes in how my clothes fit, especially around my waistline, which I hadn‚Äôt expected. This drink wasn‚Äôt just keeping my digestion on track; it was also giving my metabolism a gentle boost every morning. By drinking this concoction on an empty stomach, I set the stage for my digestive system to function optimally for the rest of the day. It‚Äôs not about chasing weight loss fads‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating a healthy, sustainable routine that supports your body in the long run. If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned from my experience as a health expert, it‚Äôs that energy and mood are deeply connected to your morning routine. Starting my day with turmeric and lemon water has not only boosted my energy but has also improved my mood in ways I didn‚Äôt anticipate. This simple drink gives me a mental clarity and physical vitality that sets a positive tone for the rest of my day. Turmeric‚Äôs Role in Mental Clarity Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, is known to support brain health by increasing levels of a hormone called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is like fertilizer for your brain cells‚Äîit helps them grow, repair, and function optimally. For someone like me, who juggles work, family, and personal time, this has been a game-changer. I feel more focused and less mentally fatigued, even on days when my schedule is packed. I‚Äôve also noticed that my mood is more stable. There used to be days when I‚Äôd wake up feeling irritable or low for no particular reason. But after incorporating turmeric into my routine, I feel more balanced and resilient. It‚Äôs as if the drink helps clear the mental ‚Äúfog‚Äù and gives me a fresh start each morning. Lemon‚Äôs Energy Boost Lemon, on the other hand, provides a natural and gentle energy lift. Its high vitamin C content helps combat oxidative stress, leaving me feeling rejuvenated. Unlike caffeine, which can cause jitters and crashes, the energy I get from lemon is steady and long-lasting. I also believe that starting the day with a warm, soothing drink has a psychological benefit‚Äîit feels like a small act of self-care that sets a positive tone for the hours ahead. To make it relatable, think about those mornings when you‚Äôre running late, rushing out the door with an empty stomach or just a cup of coffee in hand. Compare that to starting the day with something nourishing and warm, like this drink. The difference is night and day‚Äînot just physically, but emotionally too. One of the most important benefits I‚Äôve experienced from this morning ritual is improved heart health. Cardiovascular health is something we often take for granted until there‚Äôs a problem, but it‚Äôs crucial to take preventive measures. Drinking turmeric and lemon water daily has given me peace of mind, knowing that I‚Äôm actively supporting my heart‚Äôs health. Turmeric for Reducing Inflammation Chronic inflammation is a key factor in heart disease, and turmeric‚Äôs anti-inflammatory properties make it a natural ally for your heart. By reducing inflammation, turmeric helps lower the risk of arterial plaque buildup, which can lead to heart attacks or strokes. I‚Äôve noticed that my cholesterol levels have remained within a healthy range since I started this routine, which is a huge relief given my family‚Äôs history of heart issues. Lemon‚Äôs Role in Heart Health Lemon also contributes to heart health in several ways. It‚Äôs rich in potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure. High blood pressure runs in my family, so this is something I keep a close eye on. By adding lemon to my daily routine, I feel like I‚Äôm taking an active step to maintain healthy blood pressure levels. Additionally, the antioxidants in lemon help reduce oxidative stress, which is another factor in preventing heart disease. What I love most about this ritual is how simple and affordable it is. You don‚Äôt need expensive supplements, fancy gadgets, or complicated routines to reap these benefits. All you need is turmeric, a lemon, and some warm water. It‚Äôs a wellness hack that‚Äôs accessible to almost everyone, regardless of your budget or lifestyle. Easy to Incorporate into Any Routine For me, the simplicity of this practice is what makes it sustainable. Whether I‚Äôm at home, traveling, or dealing with a busy morning, it‚Äôs easy to prepare. I keep a small container of ground turmeric and a few lemons in my kitchen at all times. On particularly hectic days, I‚Äôve even prepared a small thermos of the drink to take with me on the go. There‚Äôs no excuse not to prioritize my health with something this easy and effective. An Investment in Your Health When I think about all the money I‚Äôve spent on skincare products, supplements, and diet programs over the years, it amazes me that such a simple drink has delivered some of the most noticeable results. It‚Äôs a reminder that the best solutions are often the simplest ones. By investing just a few minutes each morning, I‚Äôve made a lasting impact on my overall well-being. For those who are curious, here‚Äôs how I prepare my turmeric and lemon water: 1. Heat about a cup of water until it‚Äôs warm but not boiling. 2. Add a quarter teaspoon of ground turmeric (you can adjust this to your taste). 3. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the water. 4. Stir well and drink it slowly, savoring each sip. For an extra boost, I sometimes add a pinch of black pepper, which enhances the absorption of curcumin, or a teaspoon of honey for a touch of sweetness. In my 15 years as a health expert and my personal journey as a woman striving for better health, this morning drink has been one of the most transformative habits I‚Äôve adopted. It‚Äôs more than just a beverage‚Äîit‚Äôs a symbol of self-care, a commitment to my well-being, and a daily reminder that small steps can lead to big results. If you‚Äôre looking for a natural, effective way to boost your health, I encourage you to try this simple ritual. Whether you‚Äôre aiming for better skin, improved digestion, or just a more energized and balanced start to your day, turmeric and lemon water can make a real difference. And who knows? It might just become the highlight of your morning routine, as it has for me. -- -- Health tips, Health remedies to help maximize your everyday life and stay healthy Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\"}\n",

      "{'Title': 'Heal Your Soul by Truly Understanding Who You Are | by Mohammed Roushan | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': 'Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Mohammed Roushan Follow -- Listen Share In a world bustling with constant noise, endless distractions, and external pressures, it‚Äôs easy to lose sight of who you truly are. We often wear masks to meet societal expectations, bury our emotions to appear strong, and pursue goals that may not resonate with our true selves. This disconnect from our authentic nature can leave us feeling empty, stressed, or unfulfilled. Healing your soul begins with the profound yet liberating journey of self-discovery. It‚Äôs about peeling back the layers, embracing your essence, and understanding the unique being that you are. Your soul is the core of your existence ‚Äì the seat of your emotions, thoughts, and inner peace. When you truly understand yourself, you unlock the ability to heal emotionally, mentally, and even physically. A lack of self-awareness can lead to decisions that are misaligned with your values, relationships that drain your energy, and a life that feels untrue to who you are. The process of understanding who you are is a journey, not a destination. It requires patience, honesty, and vulnerability. Here are some steps to help you along the way: 1.Reflect on Your Past Your experiences shape who you are, but they don‚Äôt define you. Take time to reflect on significant moments in your life ‚Äì the triumphs, the challenges, and even the failures. Ask yourself: What Lessons Have I Learned? How have these experiences influenced my beliefs and behavior? Acknowledging your past, including unresolved pain, can help you release what no longer serves you and make peace with yourself. 2.Identify Your Core Values What truly matters to you? Your values are the compass that guides your decisions and actions. When you live in alignment with them, you feel at peace; when you don‚Äôt, inner conflict arises. Spend time identifying your core values. Are they love, honesty, freedom, creativity, or growth? Use these values to evaluate whether your current life aligns with your authentic self. 3.Practice Self-Awareness Self-awareness is the foundation of self-discovery. It involves observing your thoughts, emotions, and actions without judgment. Journaling can be a powerful tool for this. Write about your feelings, dreams, and fears. Over time, patterns will emerge that offer insight into your true self. Meditation is another effective practice that quiets the mind and allows you to tune into your inner voice. 4.Embrace Your Strengths and Weaknesses Understanding yourself means accepting every part of you ‚Äì the good, the bad, and the messy. Your strengths are gifts, and your weaknesses are opportunities for growth. Don‚Äôt shy away from your imperfections; they make you human. When you stop seeking perfection, you create space for healing and self-love. 5.Let Go of Societal Expectations Many of us carry the weight of societal norms and expectations that dictate how we should live our lives. These external pressures can disconnect you from your true self. Ask yourself: Am I pursuing this career, relationship, or lifestyle for myself or to meet others‚Äô expectations? Letting go of what doesn‚Äôt resonate with you allows you to reclaim your power and live authentically. 6.Connect with Your Inner Child Your inner child is the purest, most authentic version of you. Reconnecting with this part of yourself can help you rediscover forgotten dreams, passions, and joys. What made you happiest as a child? Incorporating these elements into your life can reignite your spirit. As you begin to understand who you are, a sense of inner peace emerges. Here‚Äôs how self-understanding heals your soul: Emotional Healing:Understanding your emotions allows you to process and release them, reducing stress and anxiety. Improved Relationships: When you know and accept yourself, you attract healthier and more fulfilling connections. Enhanced Confidence: Self-awareness helps you trust your decisions and embrace your uniqueness without seeking external validation. The ultimate goal of self-discovery is not to change who you are but to become more of yourself. Embracing your authenticity means celebrating your quirks, following your heart, and standing firm in your truth. It‚Äôs about living with intention and creating a life that reflects your soul‚Äôs desires. Healing your soul by understanding who you are isn‚Äôt always easy, but it‚Äôs one of the most rewarding journeys you‚Äôll ever undertake. Each step brings you closer to a life of freedom, joy, and fulfillment. So, take a deep breath, tune into your inner voice, and start uncovering the beautiful, complex, and resilient person within you. You are worth the journey.

As many people probably know, apart from China, most Western countries don‚Äôt drink hot water. They‚Äôre more accustomed to drinking cold water directly, and there are reasons for this. In Western countries, water purification systems are highly advanced, so the water that comes out of their taps is safe to drink directly. That‚Äôs why I often saw my foreign colleagues drinking tap water in the office. Nowadays, many of us in China also have bottled water at home, but one of the main functions of water dispensers is to boil water. People abroad, whether men or women, almost never drink hot water.

      "{'Title': 'How Could Trump‚Äôs Policies Redefine Abortion Access in America? | by Nia kullen | Jan, 2025 | Medium', 'Text': \"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Nia kullen Follow -- Listen Share The ongoing debate surrounding abortion in the United States has been deeply influenced by Donald Trump‚Äôs policies and their lasting impact on reproductive rights. Trump‚Äôs presidency marked a turning point, with his administration prioritizing conservative ideologies that sought to reshape abortion access. As discussions emerge about Trump‚Äôs potential return to office, it‚Äôs important to evaluate how his policies could redefine abortion access in America. During his presidency, Donald Trump‚Äôs administration implemented several measures that significantly restricted abortion access. His reinstatement and expansion of the ‚ÄúMexico City Policy‚Äù ‚Äî commonly known as the Global Gag Rule ‚Äî prohibited U.S. funding for international organizations providing abortion-related services or information. Domestically, his administration rolled back Title X funding for clinics that referred patients for abortions, leaving millions of low-income individuals with limited options for reproductive healthcare. Moreover, Trump appointed three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, cementing a 6‚Äì3 conservative majority.This ideological shift culminated in the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade.States were given unprecedented authority to restrict or ban abortion, resulting in disparities in abortion access across the nation. Conservative lawmakers and judges played a pivotal role in advancing Trump‚Äôs anti-abortion agenda. State legislatures in Republican-controlled states passed restrictive laws, such as heartbeat bills and near-total abortion bans. Many of these laws relied on the judicial support of Trump-appointed federal judges, who often upheld the legality of these measures. If Trump were to regain office, his influence on federal and state judiciary appointments could further empower lawmakers to pass even stricter regulations. This could potentially lead to the erosion of access to medical abortion, including pills like Misoprostol, which is a widely used and safe method for terminating early pregnancies. Healthcare providers and clinics have borne the brunt of restrictive abortion policies. Many facilities offering abortion services have shut down due to legal hurdles, reduced funding, or fear of criminal liability. This trend could escalate under a renewed Trump presidency, leaving women in states with abortion bans no choice but tobuy abortion pills online. The crackdown on abortion access has also placed significant pressure on providers offering medical abortion Misoprostol. These medications are critical for women unable to access in-clinic procedures due to geographic or financial constraints. A potential Trump presidency could result in stricter regulations, making it harder for women to access abortion pills safely and legally. Trump‚Äôs policies have already left a profound mark on abortion access in America. With his potential return to the White House, there are growing concerns about the future of reproductive rights.For many women, unplanned pregnancy will increasingly lead to seeking abortion pills online or exploring alternative methods, emphasizing the urgent need for policy reforms that prioritize healthcare equity. By examining Trump‚Äôs past policies and their implications, it becomes clear that the battle for abortion access is far from over. As the conversation continues, safeguarding reproductive rights remains crucial for women across the nation. -- -- Hello, I'm Nia Kullen from Florida, an MPH graduate working on projects focused on reproductive health, pregnancy, and abortion to drive positive change.

      "One evening, it showered outside. My mom grabbed a vessel to collect the rainwater. She ran to the terrace and placed it on the beam. The rain stopped within a few minutes. I eagerly went to take the vessel but ended in dismay. I thought half of the pot would have been filled. Only 5% of the pot has been filled. Anyhow, I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste it. I wondered why we hadn‚Äôt considered tasting the rainwater all these years. I thought drinking rainwater would catch cold for me. I also believed that it would be tasteless or neutral. With all curiosity, I had a sip. Wow‚Ä¶ It was as sweet as the filtered water that we drank every day. It isn‚Äôt similar to that but possesses a unique taste. No water in the world tastes similar to rainwater. We install water purifiers at home to bring that taste. But, God has made it naturally without any water purifiers. His blessing has been instilled in the rainwater. I could drink only a very little as I had to share with my mom and aunt too. My aunt said that one of our neighbours cooks food only with rainwater. My curiosity spikes high to give it a try. -- -- 4 ‚ÄúReaders Club‚Äù is a reader-centered publication that delivers valuable insights across diverse topics.

      "How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

With all curiosity, I had a sip. Wow‚Ä¶ It was as sweet as the filtered water that we drank every day. It isn‚Äôt similar to that but possesses a unique taste. No water in the world tastes similar to rainwater. We install water purifiers at home to bring that taste. But, God has made it naturally without any water purifiers. His blessing has been instilled in the rainwater. I could drink only a very little as I had to share with my mom and aunt too. My aunt said that one of our neighbours cooks food only with rainwater. My curiosity spikes high to give it a try. -- -- 4 ‚ÄúReaders Club‚Äù is a reader-centered publication that delivers valuable insights across diverse topics.

      "How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

      "Welcome to the future, my friend! You know how we‚Äôve all been talking about robots, self-driving cars, and the AI takeover? Well, 2025 has officially arrived, and AI isn‚Äôt just a buzzword anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs running the show. We‚Äôre not talking about simple tasks anymore; AI is getting morepersonal, morecreative, and even a littleemotional(yes, AI has feelings now, sort of). So buckle up, because this post is about to dive into the quirkiest, most game-changing AI trends of 2025. Let‚Äôs break it down and have some fun while we‚Äôre at it. Okay, picture this: you‚Äôre having a rough day, and your phone ‚Äî without any drama ‚Äî sends you a text that says, ‚ÄúHey, I got your back.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs not your BFF; it‚Äôs Emotional AI. Yes, AI is finally gettingin touchwith its feelings! Emotional AI? It‚Äôs like your AI bestie who knows when you need a pep talk, or maybe just a virtual hug. Generative AI was cool before, but now? Oh boy. AI 2.0 is thecreative geniuswe never knew we needed. This isn‚Äôt just about generating text; we‚Äôre talking full-on art, stories, and even movies ‚Äî no human needed. www.sequoiacap.com Generative AI is no longer the assistant; it‚Äôs thestar of the show. Just wait until you see what it can come up with next. Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî businesses love efficiency. And what‚Äôs more efficient than AI doing all the boring stuff so you can focus onbig ideas? Businesses are waking up to the power of AI, and it‚Äôstotallyreshaping the way things get done. Efficiency is the name of the game, and AI is the MVP. Hold on. While AI is doing some pretty mind-blowing things, we need to keep it in check. Ethical AI is like the parental figure saying, ‚ÄúOkay, but only if you follow the rules.‚Äù And it‚Äôs about time. Ethical AI is the safety net that ensures we use this powerful tool for good, not for‚Ä¶ you know, world domination. (But wearekeeping an eye on that). Wait, did you say AI is helping save the planet? Yep, you heard that right. It‚Äôs not all about robots taking over the world; AI is actually doing its part to keep the Earth from going full-on disaster movie. www.weforum.org AI is like the eco-warrior of the future. But instead of capes, it‚Äôs all about algorithms and sensors. Go, team AI! Alright, so you‚Äôre probably wondering, ‚ÄúHow do I stay ahead of all this tech stuff?‚Äù Simple ‚Äî stay curious, keep learning, and maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî don‚Äôt get on the bad side of AI. We‚Äôre talking about upskilling in AI-related fields, embracing innovation, and using AI as your partner in crime.

      "ON JANUARY 21, 2025 BY PHOTOMOTOMAN IN POLITICAL EDITORIAL Share This! I am a retired Fire Chief, and former educator. For the last 30 years of my 43 year career in the fire service, I attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. It started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. That was 32 years ago. It became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. And throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, CEO‚Äôs, CAO‚Äôs, CFO‚Äôs, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. All ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. For me, my experience first began in earnest in 1989, when fires ravaged northern Manitoba, my province. I was contracted to the Provincial Government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. In my time off from being a full-time firefighter, I trained as SARTEC, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which I acquired privately by training outside the country. I also travelled throughout the North under contract. That year, fires forced the evacuation of 25,000 people across 25 communities. However in 2003, I resigned from my fire department in order to take a Fire Chief‚Äôs position in another Province. I had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in British Columbia where I had been, technically hired. That year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was 54 million dollars. By the end of the summer, the Province of British Columbia had spent 554 million dollars fighting those fires. In the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as I had already resigned my position, I took a position as the Fire Chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in Ontario, Canada in the Region of Niagara. After eight years, I found myself successfully hired as the Fire Chief for a jurisdiction in Alberta, Canada, that surrounded Calgary, Alberta. Within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Provincial Park. The fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. My attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for 150 years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. It is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over 9,000 wells drilled in 2010. I often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? I will never know, but based on what is occurring in Canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. They divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. As my contract ended, and I began a job consulting, in May 2011, a forest fire surrounding Slave Lake, Alberta, home to 7000 people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. The loss amounted to 700 million dollars. Five years later, in May 2016, Fort McMurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of 2,400 structures. The loss amounted to 3.7 billion dollars, just in insured losses. A 2017 study from MacEwan University estimated total losses were in the range of $9 billion dollars. In 2023, Canada‚Äôs most destructive year to date, there were more than 6,000 fires, and 29 mega fires, that burned 41 million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in Canada. Experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. And then this year, Jasper, Alberta, one of the jewels of Canada‚Äôs National Parks saw a fire burn 1,113 structures. None of these occurrences is normal. None of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. They are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, in Lytton, BC, another Canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. The temperatures for the last three years having exceeded 41 C. At some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in Canada in 2021 of 49.2 C or 121 F. This is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. What Does All This Have To Do With Los Angeles? This week Audie Cornish of CNN did a podcast. Her guest was Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist for NASA. His former home, which was destroyed in the Los Angeles community of Altadena, was one of the more than 12,000 homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. Peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, ‚ÄúAs a Climate Scientist, I knew it was time to leave Los Angeles,‚Äù on January 10th, in the New York Times. His personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire 14 years he had lived in Altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to Durham, North Carolina. He did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in Southern California and Nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. And this last week, he was proved right. What is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on Fox and to the incoming President of the United States, a man who hasn‚Äôt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. The problem according to Kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. Less than half of America elected the current President of the United States (49.9%), yet this ‚Äòmandate‚Äô enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. They are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. So, Where is Safe? One of Kalmus‚Äô beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. Not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, 50 years ago, is daunting. Much of what is to come, is baked into our future. Of that, there is certainty. And whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the question remains. Where is safe? Kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. Climate change is global. Obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the United States and Canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. But Ashland, North Carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. So was Lytton, British Columbia. We are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. It will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. And because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. And none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- My name is Ken McMullen. I‚Äôm a retired Director of Emergency Services and former academic.

      "Life is really tough for women, especially those in middle age. Eileen Chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. When they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but there‚Äôs no one they can depend on. Actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. Men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. But that‚Äôs not how it is for women. They carry so much more on their shoulders. They can pick up the weight, but they can‚Äôt put it down. It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work. When all of these things come crashing down at once, a woman will still stand strong, even though she feels totally helpless. Middle-aged women may seem tough, but they still have weaknesses. And often, a midlife meltdown starts with these three things. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",
      "Even though I am happy in my current relationship, I find that I have some unresolved regrets and baggage from past relationships that are still affecting me. Some of the issues are fear-based thinking, the need for compassion, and intergenerational trauma from my parents and are from past romantic relationships.

      "The Heart That Matters By Terri Rimmer Shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment Melody‚Äôs neighbor Samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. Fantastic! She thought. The establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. ‚ÄúYou can just give them $5, and they‚Äôll accept that, if you have it,‚Äù Samantha, who used a wheelchair, told Melody. In a few days they went to lunch there with Samantha‚Äôs granddaughter and Melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. She would be back definitely. Over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay ‚Äî or not. She found out though that they did not want her five dollars. They wanted more and made that clear. Two years prior, Melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldn‚Äôt afford to get another vehicle. Because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. She was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. A friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment Melody couldn‚Äôt do the work. Now she‚Äôd been out of a job for four years, the longest she‚Äôd ever been unemployed. Melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldn‚Äôt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. The other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but Melody‚Äôs injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. The third time Melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something Samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. She found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didn‚Äôt mind, except for this group‚Äôs attitude of entitlement. Melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. She was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. But a professional writer/former pet and house sitter also with 40 years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. Melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. And some would ask her for money which she found laughable. The owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didn‚Äôt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. He gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. This was not the person she was. Now it was Christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough she‚Äôd had over a year that she‚Äôd been on over 19 medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. The allergist had given her the answer she‚Äôd been seeking since last year regarding her condition ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt contagious, it wasn‚Äôt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. Whew! She was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. Others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed Melody. The manager took her name, and she didn‚Äôt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. She couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. No sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. ‚ÄúHi, friend,‚Äù he said insincerely. ‚ÄúYou seem like you don‚Äôt feel well.‚Äù Melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didn‚Äôt believe her. ‚ÄúWell, if you can‚Äôt get that coughing under control you can‚Äôt eat today,‚Äù he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. She thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. The woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. The manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. So, once he walked away Melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldn‚Äôt see it. ‚ÄúI know how it is,‚Äù Melody told the woman. ‚ÄúI was in a group home before.‚Äù So, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. Now Melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. As she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. ‚ÄúHonestly, it doesn‚Äôt get any better than the mission here!‚Äù spouted a customer. -- -- I have 41 years of journalism experience having written for ten newspapers, some magazines, and web sites.

I‚Äôm not really craving alcohol anymore, and I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm currently elliptical and can‚Äôt properly run for the time-being. My last run was a treadmill run. My knees and my hip started hurting immediately. But my stubborn ass said, ‚ÄúHaha, no‚Äù and I put on another episode of my zombie thing and kept running. Despite the pain, I can confirm that run #6 sucked quite a bit less than run #1. I was able to do my signature slow-jog for about 15 minutes before I stopped, and I only stopped because I needed water. I even started to zone out a little, and think about other things. But now, in addition to fucking up my hip, I also have pretty constant pain my knees. Since those things are all pretty important, I took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). I know PT is something I need to do because I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. However I would MUCH rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. Ugh. Or RUNNING SHOES. But I‚Äôm making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. Anyway, I now have a PT plan to help with the pain. And even though Iknowit will help me feel better, I will certainly not be excited about doing it. I‚Äôm also an instant gratification human, which is another reason that long-term projects are hard for me. I find myself rushing through writing and rushing through art projects just because I want them to bedone.I try to take shortcuts. I don‚Äôt take the time totrulycrease the origami paper, so my cranes always look wonky. I haven‚Äôt felt very inspired on the writing front lately. I know these running diaries aren‚Äôt very exciting, but they have been helping me stay motivated. There was no way I could publish a part one and not follow it up. I think I‚Äôll hold off on updates until I run a 5k. I‚Äôm not submitting these to any publication, they‚Äôre kind of just going out into the ether‚Ä¶but hell, if it inspires justoneperson to try something they hate as much as I hate running, that‚Äôs a victory. -- -- AI-Free, anxious millennial writing since 2024.

      "How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

      "Welcome to the future, my friend! You know how we‚Äôve all been talking about robots, self-driving cars, and the AI takeover? Well, 2025 has officially arrived, and AI isn‚Äôt just a buzzword anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs running the show. We‚Äôre not talking about simple tasks anymore; AI is getting morepersonal, morecreative, and even a littleemotional(yes, AI has feelings now, sort of). So buckle up, because this post is about to dive into the quirkiest, most game-changing AI trends of 2025. Let‚Äôs break it down and have some fun while we‚Äôre at it. Okay, picture this: you‚Äôre having a rough day, and your phone ‚Äî without any drama ‚Äî sends you a text that says, ‚ÄúHey, I got your back.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs not your BFF; it‚Äôs Emotional AI. Yes, AI is finally gettingin touchwith its feelings! Emotional AI? It‚Äôs like your AI bestie who knows when you need a pep talk, or maybe just a virtual hug. Generative AI was cool before, but now?

This isn‚Äôt just about generating text; we‚Äôre talking full-on art, stories, and even movies ‚Äî no human needed. www.sequoiacap.com Generative AI is no longer the assistant; it‚Äôs thestar of the show. Just wait until you see what it can come up with next. Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî businesses love efficiency. And what‚Äôs more efficient than AI doing all the boring stuff so you can focus onbig ideas? Businesses are waking up to the power of AI, and it‚Äôstotallyreshaping the way things get done. Efficiency is the name of the game, and AI is the MVP. Hold on. While AI is doing some pretty mind-blowing things, we need to keep it in check. Ethical AI is like the parental figure saying, ‚ÄúOkay, but only if you follow the rules.‚Äù And it‚Äôs about time. Ethical AI is the safety net that ensures we use this powerful tool for good, not for‚Ä¶ you know, world domination. (But wearekeeping an eye on that). Wait, did you say AI is helping save the planet? Yep, you heard that right. It‚Äôs not all about robots taking over the world; AI is actually doing its part to keep the Earth from going full-on disaster movie. www.weforum.org AI is like the eco-warrior of the future. But instead of capes, it‚Äôs all about algorithms and sensors. Go, team AI! Alright, so you‚Äôre probably wondering, ‚ÄúHow do I stay ahead of all this tech stuff?‚Äù Simple ‚Äî stay curious, keep learning, and maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî don‚Äôt get on the bad side of AI.

      "ON JANUARY 21, 2025 BY PHOTOMOTOMAN IN POLITICAL EDITORIAL Share This! I am a retired Fire Chief, and former educator. For the last 30 years of my 43 year career in the fire service, I attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. It started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. That was 32 years ago. It became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. And throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, CEO‚Äôs, CAO‚Äôs, CFO‚Äôs, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. All ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. For me, my experience first began in earnest in 1989, when fires ravaged northern Manitoba, my province. I was contracted to the Provincial Government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. In my time off from being a full-time firefighter, I trained as SARTEC, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which I acquired privately by training outside the country. I also travelled throughout the North under contract. That year, fires forced the evacuation of 25,000 people across 25 communities. However in 2003, I resigned from my fire department in order to take a Fire Chief‚Äôs position in another Province. I had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in British Columbia where I had been, technically hired. That year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was 54 million dollars. By the end of the summer, the Province of British Columbia had spent 554 million dollars fighting those fires. In the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as I had already resigned my position, I took a position as the Fire Chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in Ontario, Canada in the Region of Niagara. After eight years, I found myself successfully hired as the Fire Chief for a jurisdiction in Alberta, Canada, that surrounded Calgary, Alberta. Within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Provincial Park. The fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. My attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for 150 years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. It is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over 9,000 wells drilled in 2010. I often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? I will never know, but based on what is occurring in Canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. They divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. As my contract ended, and I began a job consulting, in May 2011, a forest fire surrounding Slave Lake, Alberta, home to 7000 people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. The loss amounted to 700 million dollars. Five years later, in May 2016, Fort McMurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of 2,400 structures. The loss amounted to 3.7 billion dollars, just in insured losses. A 2017 study from MacEwan University estimated total losses were in the range of $9 billion dollars. In 2023, Canada‚Äôs most destructive year to date, there were more than 6,000 fires, and 29 mega fires, that burned 41 million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in Canada. Experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. And then this year, Jasper, Alberta, one of the jewels of Canada‚Äôs National Parks saw a fire burn 1,113 structures. None of these occurrences is normal. None of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. They are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, in Lytton, BC, another Canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. The temperatures for the last three years having exceeded 41 C. At some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in Canada in 2021 of 49.2 C or 121 F. This is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. What Does All This Have To Do With Los Angeles? This week Audie Cornish of CNN did a podcast. Her guest was Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist for NASA. His former home, which was destroyed in the Los Angeles community of Altadena, was one of the more than 12,000 homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. Peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, ‚ÄúAs a Climate Scientist, I knew it was time to leave Los Angeles,‚Äù on January 10th, in the New York Times. His personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire 14 years he had lived in Altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to Durham, North Carolina. He did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in Southern California and Nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. And this last week, he was proved right. What is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on Fox and to the incoming President of the United States, a man who hasn‚Äôt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. The problem according to Kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. Less than half of America elected the current President of the United States (49.9%), yet this ‚Äòmandate‚Äô enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. They are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. So, Where is Safe? One of Kalmus‚Äô beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. Not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, 50 years ago, is daunting. Much of what is to come, is baked into our future. Of that, there is certainty. And whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the question remains. Where is safe? Kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. Climate change is global. Obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the United States and Canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. But Ashland, North Carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. So was Lytton, British Columbia. We are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. It will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. And because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. And none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- My name is Ken McMullen. I‚Äôm a retired Director of Emergency Services and former academic.

      "Life is really tough for women, especially those in middle age. Eileen Chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. When they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but there‚Äôs no one they can depend on. Actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. Men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. But that‚Äôs not how it is for women. They carry so much more on their shoulders. They can pick up the weight, but they can‚Äôt put it down. It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work. When all of these things come crashing down at once, a woman will still stand strong, even though she feels totally helpless. Middle-aged women may seem tough, but they still have weaknesses.

      "The Heart That Matters By Terri Rimmer Shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment Melody‚Äôs neighbor Samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. Fantastic! She thought. The establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. ‚ÄúYou can just give them $5, and they‚Äôll accept that, if you have it,‚Äù Samantha, who used a wheelchair, told Melody. In a few days they went to lunch there with Samantha‚Äôs granddaughter and Melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. She would be back definitely. Over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay ‚Äî or not. She found out though that they did not want her five dollars. They wanted more and made that clear. Two years prior, Melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldn‚Äôt afford to get another vehicle. Because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. She was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. A friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment Melody couldn‚Äôt do the work. Now she‚Äôd been out of a job for four years, the longest she‚Äôd ever been unemployed. Melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldn‚Äôt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. The other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but Melody‚Äôs injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. The third time Melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something Samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. She found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didn‚Äôt mind, except for this group‚Äôs attitude of entitlement. Melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. She was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. But a professional writer/former pet and house sitter also with 40 years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. Melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. And some would ask her for money which she found laughable. The owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didn‚Äôt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. He gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. This was not the person she was. Now it was Christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough she‚Äôd had over a year that she‚Äôd been on over 19 medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. The allergist had given her the answer she‚Äôd been seeking since last year regarding her condition ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt contagious, it wasn‚Äôt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. Whew! She was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. Others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed Melody. The manager took her name, and she didn‚Äôt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. She couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. No sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. ‚ÄúHi, friend,‚Äù he said insincerely. ‚ÄúYou seem like you don‚Äôt feel well.‚Äù Melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didn‚Äôt believe her. ‚ÄúWell, if you can‚Äôt get that coughing under control you can‚Äôt eat today,‚Äù he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. She thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. The woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. The manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. So, once he walked away Melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldn‚Äôt see it. ‚ÄúI know how it is,‚Äù Melody told the woman. ‚ÄúI was in a group home before.‚Äù So, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. Now Melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. As she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. ‚ÄúHonestly, it doesn‚Äôt get any better than the mission here!‚Äù spouted a customer. -- -- I have 41 years of journalism experience having written for ten newspapers, some magazines, and web sites.

I don‚Äôt create budgets, because I know what things cost and I know how much I make and I know how much money I need to have in my bank account on the first of the month. I rarely make lists. I don‚Äôt write down my goals in journals. I don‚Äôt wake up early if I don‚Äôt have to. This ‚ÄúWellness January‚Äù or whatever the hell I‚Äôm having is honestly pretty off-brand.

Here is a list of things that I have quit over the years (that I can remember): And here is a list of things that I have done for a respectable amount of time, to make myself feel better (that I can remember): As I have said before, unless it‚Äôs a necessity, I think life is too short to do things you don‚Äôt want to be doing.

Friendly reminder that I am not a medical professional or a social media influencer, so I can‚Äôt actually diagnose that. But here we are, 21 days into January. Still going strong on the no-alcohol front. Stilltryingto go strong on the running front. I‚Äôm not really craving alcohol anymore, and I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm currently elliptical and can‚Äôt properly run for the time-being. My last run was a treadmill run. My knees and my hip started hurting immediately. But my stubborn ass said, ‚ÄúHaha, no‚Äù and I put on another episode of my zombie thing and kept running. Despite the pain, I can confirm that run #6 sucked quite a bit less than run #1. I was able to do my signature slow-jog for about 15 minutes before I stopped, and I only stopped because I needed water. I even started to zone out a little, and think about other things. But now, in addition to fucking up my hip, I also have pretty constant pain my knees. Since those things are all pretty important, I took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). I know PT is something I need to do because I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. However I would MUCH rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. Ugh. Or RUNNING SHOES. But I‚Äôm making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. Anyway, I now have a PT plan to help with the pain. And even though Iknowit will help me feel better, I will certainly not be excited about doing it.

      "Are you also a perfectionist like me? I always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. Under too much pressure to be perfect, I was always an average student because instead of working hard, I kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. This all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. üòî I knew I had to make a change. It wasn‚Äôt an easy process, but I actively decided to find the solution. So, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that I can decide when to stop chasing for it. Learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. In this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve his/her full potential. It‚Äôs the obsession that creates the problem. We just have to know the limits! Do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know it‚Äôs probably unattainable? Why do we do this? Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit. Essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. It encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. From an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently ‚Äòperfect lives' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. The flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. This constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. Nobody likes failing, right? Sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. We always think like, ‚ÄúIf I aim high enough, I‚Äôll minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing‚Äù. This fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. üçÇ The problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. Impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. Furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. Excess of anything is harmful. Our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. We are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. These images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. The pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. Many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. By meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. They may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. The ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. But sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. Also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. For some of us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. We believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. It‚Äôs a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though it‚Äôs often based on flawed assumptions. Many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; it‚Äôs about earning approval and acceptance. -Brene Brown The pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. When we‚Äôre so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. We might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. Ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. Continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. Celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. As Alexander Pope aptly said, ‚Äúto err is human, to forgive divine‚Äù Embrace imperfection and recognize that it‚Äôs a natural part of the human experience. It also helps to reframe our definition of success. Instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. Did we learn something new? Did we overcome a challenge? Those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasn‚Äôt \"perfect.\" Ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. By embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives.

      "Imagine you're sitting in a doctor's office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: \"You have cancer.\" It's shocking. Every day, 60,000 people face this same unexpected reality. Most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: \"I felt perfectly healthy.\" They didn't realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. I have some terrible news: You have a1 in 5 chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. But wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. But here's the catch: It's far more complicated than it seems. Even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting I've performed. And despite all our training and research ‚Äî doctors still don't fully understand cancer. Cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. Cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. Cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body's defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine's biggest challenges. At its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. Depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. The real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don't follow the rules. Usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body's police force ‚Äî your immune system ‚Äî and removed. Even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: Now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body's defences. This buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. Initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. As the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. When the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. My colleagues and I can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. Still, that's precisely for situations I'm getting paid for, and I like it. But here's where it gets tricky: Cancer cells have a unique ability ‚Äî they can take highways through your body to spread. This process is calledmetastasis. There are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: At this point, treatment becomes more complicated. Surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. Usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. Metastasis no longer means the end ‚Äî it just means the treatment needs more personalization. But the big question remains. Damage occurs when the cell's DNA is altered. Cell DNA acts as the user manual for how your cell works. When that manual is damaged, the cell develops DNA mutations, which cause it to malfunction. There are two ways a cell can get damaged: Purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. It's like receiving an altered manual the moment you're born. Cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of DNA damage. Sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. Cancers show up much later. Bad habits usually cause this type of DNA mutation. For example (to name a few): Those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell's DNA, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. Usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. But cancer cells are smarter than you think. The more damage a cell accumulates, the more its DNA gets altered. Cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. Remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. It can now: It's like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. And here is how they do it. Cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body's defences: Yes. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. But there's an even better approach: The best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. Early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. Cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving.

What I want to talk about today was inspired by a conversation I had a few days ago while working on-site at the office. I was chatting with a colleague about working out and fitness concepts, and that conversation sparked some thoughts that I wanted to share. I‚Äôve been working with my current employer for almost three years, and I met this colleague during my first project here. I‚Äôm the project manager for our team, and she‚Äôs a software engineer. She had been working on that project longer than I had and was more experienced in many technical areas. She is a distinctive person and has provided me with valuable feedback on project management. During my first year at the company, at a department party, she mentioned that she was doing yoga and had been practicing it for some time. That left me with the impression that she‚Äôs passionate about yoga. A few days ago, when we were at a team lunch together, she asked me why I started writing about my fitness experience and understanding.

      "Reforms. Every system, every environment, and everything around us requires change after a certain time. As they say, ‚ÄúChange is the only constant.‚Äù But sometimes, we wonder how often the change is happening. The right balance of change and improvements can give you stability, but if it‚Äôs too much in a short amount of time, then it‚Äôs just chaos. We lose the whole purpose of change ‚Äî its impact. We are aspiring to be something, personally, professionally, or just in general. Some people, like me, can only thrive if they have clear goals. I do not like to entertain an impulse-driven environment because then you just become an enabler, a consumer to the chaos ‚Äî noise. A lot has been happening around us, as always. Just because you became aware of your surroundings now does not mean all the important things are happening now. As we move forward in time, we will see AI as part of us in every aspect of human life. You won‚Äôt be able to avoid it. But then, we will be part of an environment where our humanized way of things will be judged, altered, or directed through non-empathetic AI. Recently, Trump announced a major boost for AI infrastructure in the United States, with private companies planning to invest up to $500 billion over the next four years. A new venture, calledStargate, is being launched by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, according to sources familiar with the deal. Leaders from these companies, including SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman, and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, are expected to join Trump at the White House to make the announcement. The partnership will begin with a $100 billion investment and start its first project ‚Äî a data center in Texas. The plan is to expand to other states over time. Other investors are expected to join, though their identities have not yet been revealed. Stargate aims to create cutting-edge infrastructure to support AI development in the U.S. While spokespeople for SoftBank and OpenAI have not commented, this massive initiative signals a strong push to position the U.S. as a leader in AI technology. Which means AI gets funded, and every crazy idea of AI can be a reality of our future. I appreciate the funding, but when you have the power to drive innovation and lack the core fundamentals of human life and the struggles of humankind, it feels like a disconnect. I wish they could have given a more detailed approach to the agenda and prioritized what AI innovations could have benefited the people most, like healthcare, education, or energy. Some of the most crucial AI innovations that could significantly benefit humanity: First, you‚Äôll need to install the required libraries: For this example, we‚Äôll use a dataset of medical images (you can use datasets likeBreast Cancer HistopathologyorChest X-rayfrom Kaggle).

The cases of bird flu have been mostly from U.S. dairy and poultry workers. Animals like dairy cattle, wild birds, poultry flocks, and different mammals, like cats and bears, have detected the flu. There has been no person-to-person spread and the public health risk is low; with only 67 confirmed cases in the US. However, there was one person who recently died from the bird flu. On January 6, 2025, the Louisiana Department of Health announced that since December, there‚Äôs been one patient who has been hospitalized from the bird flu. That patient was the first to die in the US. Samples were taken from the patient and it turns out that the virus mutated after the infection.

      "Abortion has always been a topic of heated debate in the United States and is still full of contention and emotion. On a fundamental level, it sets women's right to decide on their body against the moral area that deals with questions like, \"When does life start?\"\" Abortion is the right to conclude about one's own body even three times over, while, on the other hand, it is the right to morals and the legality of the act of abortion. Critics, who tend to liken it to legalizing murder, may press their point about the disparity to characterize that provisional empowerment is the wrong method for managing the situation. The US history of abortion rights is characterized by significantly changing laws. The ruling, Roe v. Wade, that was in 1973 was the primary one that made women in the US have legal rights to abortion. Privacy and bodily autonomy were mentioned in the case to signify these rights, which are the main foundation. This case, however, was not valid after it was changed in 2022 by Dobbs v.

      "The idea of a global health organization predates the establishment of theWHO. In the late 19th century, international efforts to combat diseases like cholera and yellow fever laid the groundwork for cooperation across borders. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the aftermath of World War II that global leaders recognized the need for a central organization to address health issues on a worldwide scale. TheWHOwas officially established on April 7, 1948, a date now celebrated annually as World Health Day. With 61 countries signing its constitution, the WHO marked the beginning of a unified approach to tackling global health challenges. The WHO‚Äôs vision is ambitious yet simple: ‚ÄúHealth for All.‚Äù This encapsulates its mission to ensure that all people have access to essential healthcare services without suffering financial hardship. Its objectives include: The WHO emphasizes collaboration, working with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders to achieve its goals. TheWorld Health Organization‚Äôs work spans a broad spectrum of activities aimed at improving global health. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key functions: The WHO develops guidelines and standards that influence health practices worldwide. For example, it publishes the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a critical tool for tracking and diagnosing diseases. The WHO plays a pivotal role in eradicating and controlling infectious diseases. Its notable successes include the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and its ongoing efforts to eliminate polio. The organization also leads campaigns against malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, providing funding, resources, and technical expertise. During health crises such as pandemics, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks, the WHO steps in to coordinate international responses. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO distributed over 1 billion doses of vaccines through the COVAX initiative, saving countless lives. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are leading causes of death globally. The WHO advocates for preventive measures, such as reducing tobacco use, encouraging physical activity, and promoting healthy diets. The WHO is committed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. Through programs like the Every Woman Every Child initiative, it ensures better access to prenatal care, safe childbirth, and nutrition for mothers and children. Recognizing mental health as an integral part of overall well-being, the WHO works to destigmatize mental illness and improve access to mental health services. Its global mental health action plan emphasizes the need for early intervention and support systems. One of the WHO‚Äôs most celebrated accomplishments is the eradication of smallpox. Through a coordinated vaccination campaign, the disease was officially declared eradicated in 1980, saving millions of lives. Although polio remains endemic in a few regions, the WHO‚Äôs Global Polio Eradication Initiative has brought the world closer to eradicating this crippling disease. For example, cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988. The WHO has been instrumental in the fight against HIV/AIDS. By advocating for antiretroviral therapy and prevention programs, it has significantly reduced the disease‚Äôs impact in many countries.Read More -- -- <a href=\"https://www.myreview24.com/\"> Read Movie Reviews, Entertainment News, Home & Kitchen, Net Worth, News, Trending Topics, Fashion and more</a> Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

Treasuring thefirsttime seeing the result of his labor from whacking thick pods with a knife and piling the milky beans in a heap before drying later for shipment, an older guy, as he sat among workers, mostly in flip-flops and dingy shirts, held the unwrapped chocolate bar up to talk, basking in his moment of glory. Impatiently, their hands reached out until he mentioned his obligation as the eldest to taste what the stranger had given him. When he finally indulged himself, the sweetness immediately spread across his lips into a smile. Earlier, another laborer, prompted by a flashing notion, had shared what he thought with others, one of several comments the group associated with eating chocolate. ‚ÄúThis is why white people are so healthy.‚Äù Saving the wrapper in his pocket after passing the rest to others, the eldest there declared that he would take it home to show to his family, so proud of his discovery of chocolate, a delicacy forcenturiesin many parts of the world, especially oncecompaniespoured in enough milk and sugar to keep dentists and physicians in business, as patients succumbed to cavities and a litany of diseases from obesity. Count me as one of the many who enjoyed those delectable desires sweetened for addiction. Switching over gradually to the kind without any added sweetness took years before I got used to the taste. Even now, I chase that bitterness down with a banana or a pinch of raisins and constantly keep an eye on the scale, adjusting daily desires by the ounce, because I treasure good health. Otherwise, I‚Äôd eat up a few sizes from all the frigid temperatures that have kept me in this season. Jazzed bysnow, the most, from what I read online, since Valentine‚Äôs of 1895, Fat Tuesday came early for strollers in New Orleans, as unseemly weather shut down the city, while also giving mothers a reason to celebrate with their kids who, like that guy tasting chocolate first, smiled wide at the sight of soft mounds piling atop cars and layering lawns everywhere ‚Äî a memory imprinted forever in a treasured click for a photo album, adding to the joy from a day off from schoolwork. First times, as well as final ones, occupy a special place that we embrace more emotionally than whatever happened before or afterward ‚Äî whether in a tasted desire or prized memory. Memories of those first moments often last throughout life, adding layers of context for comparison as we mature and grow through the years. Once we add similar moments, that original impression slowly depreciates until it loses its luster, the charm of what made it precious in the first place. Eyes that once dazzled look elsewhere now at a dinner table. Instead of connecting deeply to refresh the feeling that we promised to hold on to forever, we slip into going through the motions of just another habit ‚Äî a hug without meaning more, just another piece of chocolate for our lips. Valentine‚Äôs Day, as well as a couple of other days throughout the year, particularly the annual sale of Leonidas Chocolate, usually brings on an urge for me to resist perhaps my favorite temptation for a delicacy. However, a frozen winter of singleness has one advantage going for it ‚Äî buying less processed chocolate to sprinkle in for a random occasion, especially with fewer bouquets of scented petals that wilt by the week. Despite missing out on delectable treats that whet my appetite each year, I manage to flavor bitter nibs daily and savor them with fruit to suit my taste.

      "Digital health startups are obsessed with technology, but what if the real competitive edge lies in skills that can‚Äôt be coded? In an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ‚Äî AI-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. Yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasn‚Äôt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. Many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. After all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary AI model is what attracts funding and headlines. But here‚Äôs the catch: digital health is not just about technology; it‚Äôs about people. Whether it‚Äôs convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. In fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô side of the business. To be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. A leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. However, technology alone can‚Äôt explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. It‚Äôs the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. Think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? Or one who can design a wearable but can‚Äôt address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? In digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. Technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but it‚Äôs time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code. Communication, empathy, and relationship-building are not optional ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential. As we shape the future of healthcare, the question is: are we building leaders who can connect as well as they can innovate? -- -- Digital Health Solutions Architect | Pharmacist | Software Engineer | AWS Certified Solutions Architect ‚Äî Associate | Content Creator Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

      "Christine Dimmick Jan 16, 2025 Yesterday with much fanfare it was announced that Red dye #3 was banned by the FDA in food products. The dye was alreadybanned in 1990in cosmetics for causing cancer in lab rats who ingested it. Fast forward 35 years, to yesterday, when it is finally banned in food, when we knew all along it caused cancer ifeaten. It was also‚Äúrestricted‚Äùin the EU in 1994, with allowance in cocktail cherries, aka Maraschino cherries. Maraschino cherries ‚Äî a preserved, candied cherry,originally never used dye in the first place. Created in Europe, the spirit companyLuxardo(who claims ownership), released them in 1821, using alcohol and sugar as the preservative. Eventually the cherries made their way to the US and then prohibition happened. in the 1920s, a professor in Oregon created his own version using calcium salts and brine as a preservative, which removed the coloring, so he added back coloring, artificially, giving them their bright red color. This colorant was banned in the 60s for causing cancer, so manufacturers started using another artificial colorant ‚Äî Red 40, which also causes cancer and neurological issues in humans. Red 40 is still used today in Maraschino cherries and many other foods and drinks and cosmetics. Let‚Äôs review. I am going to make this short and sweet. Just like us, large organizations, governments, charities, corporations also want self preservation, but the want it for the ‚Äúorganizations‚Äù interest aka the shareholders/stakeholders. They may employ humans like you and me, but they employ them to work on their behalf. Why do humans comply? The paycheck they receive serves their own self-interests enough to make them do things they know are not benefiting others. Nothing will change until we demand it. Power is never given back, and rarely is money. If we want to take our power back, we need to take power away from entities who are not protecting us. Growth is not in the ‚Äúbig‚Äù it is found in small, local community efforts where everyone has a say. But even community boards suffer from power trips. We need a system that is easily accessible and readily available to all, to share their voice and be a part of the final decision This won‚Äôt happen how we do it now. We ALL have to work and get involved. We have to read, do research. Social media is not research. Learn to read a medical study. We have to stop looking for a knight in shining armor to save us and also stop looking for it in the same places. The news, the politicians, the experts, the influencers, the pod casters are all geared to grab your interest, your wallet, your trust, your vote. Want to find real leaders? People who will represent us? People who actually will do the right thing? Find the people who aren‚Äôt influenced by money or power. Hint: they aren‚Äôt running for office, they aren‚Äôt in your social media feed and they definitely aren‚Äôt in the limelight willingly.

      "Imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. A world where individuals don‚Äôt spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like Huntington‚Äôs disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. A world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. This is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. But alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. A dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where CRISPR places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. While genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. In 2018,Chinese scientist He Jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to HIV, resulting in the birth of twin girls(Raposo). Globally,42.3 million people have died from HIV, yet with CRISPR, no more have to (‚ÄúHIV‚Äù). While this trial showcased gene editing‚Äôs revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.The experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(‚ÄúWhat are the Ethical Concerns‚Ä¶?‚Äù). A clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. But what happens when scientific experimentation isn‚Äôt strictly monitored? In the cases of theTuskegee Syphilis Study,Henrietta Lacks,Nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: Catastrophe. This same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of Nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. What happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? Prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them ‚Äî a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. Evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.A 2018 study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens‚Äô adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(Agha et al.). Narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. However, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. This technology could end generations of suffering.Genome mutations cause roughly 7,000 known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (‚ÄúUsing gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases‚Äù). CRISPR technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as Huntington‚Äôs disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable ‚Äîcurrent treatment costs of $2.2 million reflect the high expense of novel technologies‚Äî it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (Pagliarulo and Lucas). Unfortunately, humans won‚Äôt stop at disease eradication. If we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldn‚Äôt we? Enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. Targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. Take theCCR5-Œî32 mutation, which Chinese scientist He Jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(Sanders). This mutation prohibits HIV infection, yetincreases susceptibility to West Nile virus and leads to a 21% higher overall mortality rate(Sanders). This is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. Eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. Additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(‚ÄúAccelerating Global Access to Gene Therapies‚Äù). While disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. Enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. What may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. Such pursuits are simply indefensible. What is the true cost of progress? When ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? Well, let‚Äôs review a familiar example. What did He Jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? Prison. Reckless application of CRISPR technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. But on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? If genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist ‚Äî it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.The World Health Organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(‚ÄúHealth Ethics & Governance‚Äù). Without enforcement, these measures are futile. CRISPR holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. But if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. This isn‚Äôt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. As a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing? The choice ‚Äî and the responsibility ‚Äî belongs to all of us.

      "In discussions about America‚Äôs most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. Yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. This complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. It‚Äôs a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Research by Evernorth reveals a startling statistic: 93% of adults in the United States suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. This figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. The rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. Between 1999 and 2020, adult obesity rates soared from 30.5% to 41.9%. If current trends persist, half of all American adults could be classified as obese by 2030. But this is far from a superficial issue ‚Äì it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of $719 billion annually. To put this into perspective, consider Sarah, a 45-year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. Her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. Over time, she developed type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. Sarah‚Äôs story mirrors that of millions of Americans. Collectively, the costs associated with obesity ($173 billion), heart disease and stroke ($219 billion), and diabetes ($327 billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. These expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity ‚Äì making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. While individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. Social and economic factors account for 40% of health outcomes, according to public health data. These include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability ‚Äì all of which shape an individual‚Äôs ability to maintain good health. The physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (10%), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for 20% and 30%, respectively. This breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. ‚ÄúIt is better to prevent than to cure. ‚Äì Ibn Sina‚Äù The encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable ‚Äì and, in many cases, reversible. Early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. A variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. Take, for instance, the initiative led by Cigna Healthcare in partnership with Virgin Pulse. By allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. Statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. Families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. The impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. Addressing cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a moral imperative ‚Äì it‚Äôs an economic one. Companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. On a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. Much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. Healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. Integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. The stakes are enormous. Cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a set of disconnected health problems ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of American life, from families to workplaces to entire communities. This is not a challenge we can address piecemeal or delay for another generation. If we fail to act, millions will continue to face shortened lives, mounting medical bills, and preventable suffering. We‚Äôve seen what coordinated action can do in the face of major health threats like cancer or heart disease. It‚Äôs time to bring that same urgency and focus to cardiodiabesity. The longer we wait, the more lives and resources we lose to a crisis that we already know how to address. This isn‚Äôt just about statistics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about people, families, and futures that don‚Äôt have to be cut short. The responsibility to address this crisis can no longer be postponed. -- -- 1 CEO and Founder of Nudge Health Visit us atwww.mynudgehealth.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

      "Read this story for free here. This Year about 140,000 deaths were caused by alcohol.In 21 days‚Ä¶yesterday the number was 135,000. In one day 5,000 people died because of alcohol. Alcohol has been around forever and will be around for a long time. Some people are able to drink a glass occasionally for celebration and many people can not. Those are the people who I see as an addiction nurse. People who suffer from trauma, and pain, got into the notion of covering the pain by drinking alcohol to numb the painful memories. I had seen people become addicted to alcohol as a child as they were given regular drinks by parents, aunts, abusers, and more. A devastating cycle. I believe everyone deserves a chance to get out of addiction. I believe addiction is not a choice. People can easily get lost in the path down on the addiction road and can find it very difficult to get out. Many people drink socially feeling they need to do so to follow the societal norm. I am one of those people who does not follow the crowd when it comes to alcohol consumption. I have lost too many friends, family, and patients because of alcohol. It is simply not worth it for me. -- -- 5 Articles focusing on our health, mental health, public health and wellness.

      "One evening, it showered outside. My mom grabbed a vessel to collect the rainwater. She ran to the terrace and placed it on the beam. The rain stopped within a few minutes. I eagerly went to take the vessel but ended in dismay. I thought half of the pot would have been filled. Only 5% of the pot has been filled. Anyhow, I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste it. I wondered why we hadn‚Äôt considered tasting the rainwater all these years. I thought drinking rainwater would catch cold for me. I also believed that it would be tasteless or neutral. With all curiosity, I had a sip. Wow‚Ä¶ It was as sweet as the filtered water that we drank every day. It isn‚Äôt similar to that but possesses a unique taste. No water in the world tastes similar to rainwater. We install water purifiers at home to bring that taste. But, God has made it naturally without any water purifiers. His blessing has been instilled in the rainwater. I could drink only a very little as I had to share with my mom and aunt too. My aunt said that one of our neighbours cooks food only with rainwater. My curiosity spikes high to give it a try. -- -- 4 ‚ÄúReaders Club‚Äù is a reader-centered publication that delivers valuable insights across diverse topics.

      "How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

      "Welcome to the future, my friend! You know how we‚Äôve all been talking about robots, self-driving cars, and the AI takeover? Well, 2025 has officially arrived, and AI isn‚Äôt just a buzzword anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs running the show. We‚Äôre not talking about simple tasks anymore; AI is getting morepersonal, morecreative, and even a littleemotional(yes, AI has feelings now, sort of). So buckle up, because this post is about to dive into the quirkiest, most game-changing AI trends of 2025. Let‚Äôs break it down and have some fun while we‚Äôre at it. Okay, picture this: you‚Äôre having a rough day, and your phone ‚Äî without any drama ‚Äî sends you a text that says, ‚ÄúHey, I got your back.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs not your BFF; it‚Äôs Emotional AI.

      "ON JANUARY 21, 2025 BY PHOTOMOTOMAN IN POLITICAL EDITORIAL Share This! I am a retired Fire Chief, and former educator. For the last 30 years of my 43 year career in the fire service, I attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. It started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. That was 32 years ago. It became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. And throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, CEO‚Äôs, CAO‚Äôs, CFO‚Äôs, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. All ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. For me, my experience first began in earnest in 1989, when fires ravaged northern Manitoba, my province. I was contracted to the Provincial Government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. In my time off from being a full-time firefighter, I trained as SARTEC, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which I acquired privately by training outside the country. I also travelled throughout the North under contract. That year, fires forced the evacuation of 25,000 people across 25 communities. However in 2003, I resigned from my fire department in order to take a Fire Chief‚Äôs position in another Province. I had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in British Columbia where I had been, technically hired. That year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was 54 million dollars. By the end of the summer, the Province of British Columbia had spent 554 million dollars fighting those fires. In the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as I had already resigned my position, I took a position as the Fire Chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in Ontario, Canada in the Region of Niagara. After eight years, I found myself successfully hired as the Fire Chief for a jurisdiction in Alberta, Canada, that surrounded Calgary, Alberta. Within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Provincial Park. The fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. My attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for 150 years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. It is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over 9,000 wells drilled in 2010. I often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? I will never know, but based on what is occurring in Canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. They divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. As my contract ended, and I began a job consulting, in May 2011, a forest fire surrounding Slave Lake, Alberta, home to 7000 people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. The loss amounted to 700 million dollars. Five years later, in May 2016, Fort McMurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of 2,400 structures. The loss amounted to 3.7 billion dollars, just in insured losses. A 2017 study from MacEwan University estimated total losses were in the range of $9 billion dollars. In 2023, Canada‚Äôs most destructive year to date, there were more than 6,000 fires, and 29 mega fires, that burned 41 million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in Canada. Experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. And then this year, Jasper, Alberta, one of the jewels of Canada‚Äôs National Parks saw a fire burn 1,113 structures. None of these occurrences is normal. None of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. They are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, in Lytton, BC, another Canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. The temperatures for the last three years having exceeded 41 C. At some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in Canada in 2021 of 49.2 C or 121 F. This is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. What Does All This Have To Do With Los Angeles? This week Audie Cornish of CNN did a podcast. Her guest was Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist for NASA. His former home, which was destroyed in the Los Angeles community of Altadena, was one of the more than 12,000 homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. Peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, ‚ÄúAs a Climate Scientist, I knew it was time to leave Los Angeles,‚Äù on January 10th, in the New York Times. His personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire 14 years he had lived in Altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to Durham, North Carolina. He did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in Southern California and Nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. And this last week, he was proved right. What is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on Fox and to the incoming President of the United States, a man who hasn‚Äôt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. The problem according to Kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. Less than half of America elected the current President of the United States (49.9%), yet this ‚Äòmandate‚Äô enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. They are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. So, Where is Safe? One of Kalmus‚Äô beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. Not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, 50 years ago, is daunting. Much of what is to come, is baked into our future. Of that, there is certainty. And whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the question remains. Where is safe? Kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. Climate change is global. Obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the United States and Canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. But Ashland, North Carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. So was Lytton, British Columbia. We are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. It will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. And because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. And none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- My name is Ken McMullen. I‚Äôm a retired Director of Emergency Services and former academic.

      "Life is really tough for women, especially those in middle age. Eileen Chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. When they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but there‚Äôs no one they can depend on. Actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. Men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. But that‚Äôs not how it is for women. They carry so much more on their shoulders. They can pick up the weight, but they can‚Äôt put it down. It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work. When all of these things come crashing down at once, a woman will still stand strong, even though she feels totally helpless. Middle-aged women may seem tough, but they still have weaknesses. And often, a midlife meltdown starts with these three things. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",
      "Even though I am happy in my current relationship, I find that I have some unresolved regrets and baggage from past relationships that are still affecting me.

      "The Heart That Matters By Terri Rimmer Shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment Melody‚Äôs neighbor Samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. Fantastic! She thought. The establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. ‚ÄúYou can just give them $5, and they‚Äôll accept that, if you have it,‚Äù Samantha, who used a wheelchair, told Melody. In a few days they went to lunch there with Samantha‚Äôs granddaughter and Melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. She would be back definitely. Over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay ‚Äî or not. She found out though that they did not want her five dollars. They wanted more and made that clear. Two years prior, Melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldn‚Äôt afford to get another vehicle. Because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. She was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. A friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment Melody couldn‚Äôt do the work. Now she‚Äôd been out of a job for four years, the longest she‚Äôd ever been unemployed. Melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldn‚Äôt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. The other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but Melody‚Äôs injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. The third time Melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something Samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. She found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didn‚Äôt mind, except for this group‚Äôs attitude of entitlement. Melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. She was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. But a professional writer/former pet and house sitter also with 40 years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. Melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. And some would ask her for money which she found laughable. The owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didn‚Äôt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. He gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. This was not the person she was. Now it was Christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough she‚Äôd had over a year that she‚Äôd been on over 19 medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. The allergist had given her the answer she‚Äôd been seeking since last year regarding her condition ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt contagious, it wasn‚Äôt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. Whew! She was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. Others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed Melody. The manager took her name, and she didn‚Äôt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. She couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. No sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. ‚ÄúHi, friend,‚Äù he said insincerely. ‚ÄúYou seem like you don‚Äôt feel well.‚Äù Melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didn‚Äôt believe her. ‚ÄúWell, if you can‚Äôt get that coughing under control you can‚Äôt eat today,‚Äù he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. She thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. The woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. The manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. So, once he walked away Melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldn‚Äôt see it. ‚ÄúI know how it is,‚Äù Melody told the woman. ‚ÄúI was in a group home before.‚Äù So, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. Now Melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. As she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. ‚ÄúHonestly, it doesn‚Äôt get any better than the mission here!‚Äù spouted a customer. -- -- I have 41 years of journalism experience having written for ten newspapers, some magazines, and web sites.

But now, in addition to fucking up my hip, I also have pretty constant pain my knees. Since those things are all pretty important, I took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). I know PT is something I need to do because I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. However I would MUCH rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. Ugh. Or RUNNING SHOES. But I‚Äôm making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. Anyway, I now have a PT plan to help with the pain. And even though Iknowit will help me feel better, I will certainly not be excited about doing it. I‚Äôm also an instant gratification human, which is another reason that long-term projects are hard for me. I find myself rushing through writing and rushing through art projects just because I want them to bedone.I try to take shortcuts.

      "Are you also a perfectionist like me? I always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. Under too much pressure to be perfect, I was always an average student because instead of working hard, I kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. This all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. üòî I knew I had to make a change. It wasn‚Äôt an easy process, but I actively decided to find the solution. So, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that I can decide when to stop chasing for it. Learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. In this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve his/her full potential. It‚Äôs the obsession that creates the problem. We just have to know the limits! Do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know it‚Äôs probably unattainable? Why do we do this? Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit. Essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. It encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. From an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently ‚Äòperfect lives' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. The flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. This constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. Nobody likes failing, right? Sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. We always think like, ‚ÄúIf I aim high enough, I‚Äôll minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing‚Äù. This fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. üçÇ The problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. Impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. Furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. Excess of anything is harmful. Our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. We are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. These images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. The pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. Many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. By meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. They may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. The ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. But sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. Also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. For some of us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. We believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. It‚Äôs a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though it‚Äôs often based on flawed assumptions. Many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; it‚Äôs about earning approval and acceptance. -Brene Brown The pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. When we‚Äôre so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. We might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. Ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. Continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. Celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. As Alexander Pope aptly said, ‚Äúto err is human, to forgive divine‚Äù Embrace imperfection and recognize that it‚Äôs a natural part of the human experience. It also helps to reframe our definition of success. Instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. Did we learn something new? Did we overcome a challenge? Those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasn‚Äôt \"perfect.\" Ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. By embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives.

      "Imagine you're sitting in a doctor's office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: \"You have cancer.\" It's shocking. Every day, 60,000 people face this same unexpected reality. Most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: \"I felt perfectly healthy.\" They didn't realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. I have some terrible news: You have a1 in 5 chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. But wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. But here's the catch: It's far more complicated than it seems. Even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting I've performed. And despite all our training and research ‚Äî doctors still don't fully understand cancer. Cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. Cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. Cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body's defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine's biggest challenges. At its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. Depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. The real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don't follow the rules. Usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body's police force ‚Äî your immune system ‚Äî and removed. Even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: Now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body's defences. This buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. Initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. As the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. When the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. My colleagues and I can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. Still, that's precisely for situations I'm getting paid for, and I like it. But here's where it gets tricky: Cancer cells have a unique ability ‚Äî they can take highways through your body to spread. This process is calledmetastasis. There are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: At this point, treatment becomes more complicated. Surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. Usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. Metastasis no longer means the end ‚Äî it just means the treatment needs more personalization. But the big question remains. Damage occurs when the cell's DNA is altered. Cell DNA acts as the user manual for how your cell works. When that manual is damaged, the cell develops DNA mutations, which cause it to malfunction. There are two ways a cell can get damaged: Purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. It's like receiving an altered manual the moment you're born. Cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of DNA damage. Sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. Cancers show up much later. Bad habits usually cause this type of DNA mutation. For example (to name a few): Those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell's DNA, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. Usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. But cancer cells are smarter than you think. The more damage a cell accumulates, the more its DNA gets altered. Cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. Remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. It can now: It's like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. And here is how they do it. Cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body's defences: Yes. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. But there's an even better approach: The best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. Early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. Cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. Your health is worth it.

      "Reforms. Every system, every environment, and everything around us requires change after a certain time. As they say, ‚ÄúChange is the only constant.‚Äù But sometimes, we wonder how often the change is happening.

Recently, Trump announced a major boost for AI infrastructure in the United States, with private companies planning to invest up to $500 billion over the next four years. A new venture, calledStargate, is being launched by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, according to sources familiar with the deal. Leaders from these companies, including SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman, and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, are expected to join Trump at the White House to make the announcement. The partnership will begin with a $100 billion investment and start its first project ‚Äî a data center in Texas. The plan is to expand to other states over time. Other investors are expected to join, though their identities have not yet been revealed. Stargate aims to create cutting-edge infrastructure to support AI development in the U.S. While spokespeople for SoftBank and OpenAI have not commented, this massive initiative signals a strong push to position the U.S. as a leader in AI technology. Which means AI gets funded, and every crazy idea of AI can be a reality of our future. I appreciate the funding, but when you have the power to drive innovation and lack the core fundamentals of human life and the struggles of humankind, it feels like a disconnect.

      "Abortion has always been a topic of heated debate in the United States and is still full of contention and emotion. On a fundamental level, it sets women's right to decide on their body against the moral area that deals with questions like, \"When does life start?\"\" Abortion is the right to conclude about one's own body even three times over, while, on the other hand, it is the right to morals and the legality of the act of abortion. Critics, who tend to liken it to legalizing murder, may press their point about the disparity to characterize that provisional empowerment is the wrong method for managing the situation. The US history of abortion rights is characterized by significantly changing laws. The ruling, Roe v.

      "The idea of a global health organization predates the establishment of theWHO. In the late 19th century, international efforts to combat diseases like cholera and yellow fever laid the groundwork for cooperation across borders. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the aftermath of World War II that global leaders recognized the need for a central organization to address health issues on a worldwide scale. TheWHOwas officially established on April 7, 1948, a date now celebrated annually as World Health Day. With 61 countries signing its constitution, the WHO marked the beginning of a unified approach to tackling global health challenges. The WHO‚Äôs vision is ambitious yet simple: ‚ÄúHealth for All.‚Äù This encapsulates its mission to ensure that all people have access to essential healthcare services without suffering financial hardship. Its objectives include: The WHO emphasizes collaboration, working with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders to achieve its goals. TheWorld Health Organization‚Äôs work spans a broad spectrum of activities aimed at improving global health. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key functions: The WHO develops guidelines and standards that influence health practices worldwide. For example, it publishes the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a critical tool for tracking and diagnosing diseases. The WHO plays a pivotal role in eradicating and controlling infectious diseases. Its notable successes include the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and its ongoing efforts to eliminate polio. The organization also leads campaigns against malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, providing funding, resources, and technical expertise. During health crises such as pandemics, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks, the WHO steps in to coordinate international responses. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO distributed over 1 billion doses of vaccines through the COVAX initiative, saving countless lives. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are leading causes of death globally. The WHO advocates for preventive measures, such as reducing tobacco use, encouraging physical activity, and promoting healthy diets. The WHO is committed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. Through programs like the Every Woman Every Child initiative, it ensures better access to prenatal care, safe childbirth, and nutrition for mothers and children. Recognizing mental health as an integral part of overall well-being, the WHO works to destigmatize mental illness and improve access to mental health services. Its global mental health action plan emphasizes the need for early intervention and support systems. One of the WHO‚Äôs most celebrated accomplishments is the eradication of smallpox. Through a coordinated vaccination campaign, the disease was officially declared eradicated in 1980, saving millions of lives. Although polio remains endemic in a few regions, the WHO‚Äôs Global Polio Eradication Initiative has brought the world closer to eradicating this crippling disease. For example, cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988. The WHO has been instrumental in the fight against HIV/AIDS. By advocating for antiretroviral therapy and prevention programs, it has significantly reduced the disease‚Äôs impact in many countries.Read More -- -- <a href=\"https://www.myreview24.com/\"> Read Movie Reviews, Entertainment News, Home & Kitchen, Net Worth, News, Trending Topics, Fashion and more</a> Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

A primitive root; to rest (as at home); causatively (through the implied idea of beauty, to celebrate (with praises) ‚Äî keep at home, prepare habitation. Treasuring thefirsttime seeing the result of his labor from whacking thick pods with a knife and piling the milky beans in a heap before drying later for shipment, an older guy, as he sat among workers, mostly in flip-flops and dingy shirts, held the unwrapped chocolate bar up to talk, basking in his moment of glory. Impatiently, their hands reached out until he mentioned his obligation as the eldest to taste what the stranger had given him. When he finally indulged himself, the sweetness immediately spread across his lips into a smile. Earlier, another laborer, prompted by a flashing notion, had shared what he thought with others, one of several comments the group associated with eating chocolate. ‚ÄúThis is why white people are so healthy.‚Äù Saving the wrapper in his pocket after passing the rest to others, the eldest there declared that he would take it home to show to his family, so proud of his discovery of chocolate, a delicacy forcenturiesin many parts of the world, especially oncecompaniespoured in enough milk and sugar to keep dentists and physicians in business, as patients succumbed to cavities and a litany of diseases from obesity. Count me as one of the many who enjoyed those delectable desires sweetened for addiction. Switching over gradually to the kind without any added sweetness took years before I got used to the taste. Even now, I chase that bitterness down with a banana or a pinch of raisins and constantly keep an eye on the scale, adjusting daily desires by the ounce, because I treasure good health. Otherwise, I‚Äôd eat up a few sizes from all the frigid temperatures that have kept me in this season. Jazzed bysnow, the most, from what I read online, since Valentine‚Äôs of 1895, Fat Tuesday came early for strollers in New Orleans, as unseemly weather shut down the city, while also giving mothers a reason to celebrate with their kids who, like that guy tasting chocolate first, smiled wide at the sight of soft mounds piling atop cars and layering lawns everywhere ‚Äî a memory imprinted forever in a treasured click for a photo album, adding to the joy from a day off from schoolwork. First times, as well as final ones, occupy a special place that we embrace more emotionally than whatever happened before or afterward ‚Äî whether in a tasted desire or prized memory. Memories of those first moments often last throughout life, adding layers of context for comparison as we mature and grow through the years. Once we add similar moments, that original impression slowly depreciates until it loses its luster, the charm of what made it precious in the first place. Eyes that once dazzled look elsewhere now at a dinner table. Instead of connecting deeply to refresh the feeling that we promised to hold on to forever, we slip into going through the motions of just another habit ‚Äî a hug without meaning more, just another piece of chocolate for our lips. Valentine‚Äôs Day, as well as a couple of other days throughout the year, particularly the annual sale of Leonidas Chocolate, usually brings on an urge for me to resist perhaps my favorite temptation for a delicacy. However, a frozen winter of singleness has one advantage going for it ‚Äî buying less processed chocolate to sprinkle in for a random occasion, especially with fewer bouquets of scented petals that wilt by the week. Despite missing out on delectable treats that whet my appetite each year, I manage to flavor bitter nibs daily and savor them with fruit to suit my taste. Consequently, I refresh an edible joy that keeps me coming back for more each day, though rather hard-pressed to remember that first taste of chocolate ever. If I reacted similarly to the man in the video after that first bite of chocolate, my impression faded quickly amid sweetness packaged on shelves easily within reach, perhaps in preparing me for a world filled with irresistible eye candy often painted on lips. This morning‚Äôs reading treasures wisdom that knows which desires mean more and which pleasures require greater self-discipline. Each day, we encounter a new opportunity to improve on the day before or just drift back to the pack of mediocrity ‚Äî that first nibble for a taste of what lies ahead or fresh snow for a memory in years to come.

      "Digital health startups are obsessed with technology, but what if the real competitive edge lies in skills that can‚Äôt be coded? In an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ‚Äî AI-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. Yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasn‚Äôt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. Many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. After all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary AI model is what attracts funding and headlines. But here‚Äôs the catch: digital health is not just about technology; it‚Äôs about people. Whether it‚Äôs convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. In fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô side of the business. To be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. A leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. However, technology alone can‚Äôt explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. It‚Äôs the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. Think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? Or one who can design a wearable but can‚Äôt address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? In digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. Technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but it‚Äôs time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code. Communication, empathy, and relationship-building are not optional ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential.

      "Christine Dimmick Jan 16, 2025 Yesterday with much fanfare it was announced that Red dye #3 was banned by the FDA in food products. The dye was alreadybanned in 1990in cosmetics for causing cancer in lab rats who ingested it. Fast forward 35 years, to yesterday, when it is finally banned in food, when we knew all along it caused cancer ifeaten. It was also‚Äúrestricted‚Äùin the EU in 1994, with allowance in cocktail cherries, aka Maraschino cherries. Maraschino cherries ‚Äî a preserved, candied cherry,originally never used dye in the first place. Created in Europe, the spirit companyLuxardo(who claims ownership), released them in 1821, using alcohol and sugar as the preservative. Eventually the cherries made their way to the US and then prohibition happened. in the 1920s, a professor in Oregon created his own version using calcium salts and brine as a preservative, which removed the coloring, so he added back coloring, artificially, giving them their bright red color. This colorant was banned in the 60s for causing cancer, so manufacturers started using another artificial colorant ‚Äî Red 40, which also causes cancer and neurological issues in humans. Red 40 is still used today in Maraschino cherries and many other foods and drinks and cosmetics. Let‚Äôs review. I am going to make this short and sweet. Just like us, large organizations, governments, charities, corporations also want self preservation, but the want it for the ‚Äúorganizations‚Äù interest aka the shareholders/stakeholders. They may employ humans like you and me, but they employ them to work on their behalf. Why do humans comply? The paycheck they receive serves their own self-interests enough to make them do things they know are not benefiting others. Nothing will change until we demand it. Power is never given back, and rarely is money. If we want to take our power back, we need to take power away from entities who are not protecting us. Growth is not in the ‚Äúbig‚Äù it is found in small, local community efforts where everyone has a say. But even community boards suffer from power trips. We need a system that is easily accessible and readily available to all, to share their voice and be a part of the final decision This won‚Äôt happen how we do it now. We ALL have to work and get involved. We have to read, do research. Social media is not research. Learn to read a medical study. We have to stop looking for a knight in shining armor to save us and also stop looking for it in the same places. The news, the politicians, the experts, the influencers, the pod casters are all geared to grab your interest, your wallet, your trust, your vote. Want to find real leaders? People who will represent us? People who actually will do the right thing? Find the people who aren‚Äôt influenced by money or power.

      "Imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. A world where individuals don‚Äôt spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like Huntington‚Äôs disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. A world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. This is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. But alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. A dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where CRISPR places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. While genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. In 2018,Chinese scientist He Jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to HIV, resulting in the birth of twin girls(Raposo). Globally,42.3 million people have died from HIV, yet with CRISPR, no more have to (‚ÄúHIV‚Äù). While this trial showcased gene editing‚Äôs revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.The experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(‚ÄúWhat are the Ethical Concerns‚Ä¶?‚Äù). A clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. But what happens when scientific experimentation isn‚Äôt strictly monitored? In the cases of theTuskegee Syphilis Study,Henrietta Lacks,Nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: Catastrophe. This same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of Nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. What happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? Prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them ‚Äî a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. Evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.A 2018 study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens‚Äô adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(Agha et al.). Narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. However, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. This technology could end generations of suffering.Genome mutations cause roughly 7,000 known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (‚ÄúUsing gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases‚Äù). CRISPR technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as Huntington‚Äôs disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable ‚Äîcurrent treatment costs of $2.2 million reflect the high expense of novel technologies‚Äî it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (Pagliarulo and Lucas). Unfortunately, humans won‚Äôt stop at disease eradication. If we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldn‚Äôt we? Enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. Targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. Take theCCR5-Œî32 mutation, which Chinese scientist He Jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(Sanders). This mutation prohibits HIV infection, yetincreases susceptibility to West Nile virus and leads to a 21% higher overall mortality rate(Sanders). This is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. Eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. Additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(‚ÄúAccelerating Global Access to Gene Therapies‚Äù). While disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. Enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. What may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. Such pursuits are simply indefensible. What is the true cost of progress? When ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? Well, let‚Äôs review a familiar example. What did He Jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? Prison. Reckless application of CRISPR technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. But on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? If genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist ‚Äî it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.The World Health Organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(‚ÄúHealth Ethics & Governance‚Äù). Without enforcement, these measures are futile. CRISPR holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. But if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. This isn‚Äôt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. As a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing? The choice ‚Äî and the responsibility ‚Äî belongs to all of us.

      "In discussions about America‚Äôs most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. Yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. This complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. It‚Äôs a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Research by Evernorth reveals a startling statistic: 93% of adults in the United States suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. This figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. The rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. Between 1999 and 2020, adult obesity rates soared from 30.5% to 41.9%. If current trends persist, half of all American adults could be classified as obese by 2030. But this is far from a superficial issue ‚Äì it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of $719 billion annually. To put this into perspective, consider Sarah, a 45-year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. Her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. Over time, she developed type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. Sarah‚Äôs story mirrors that of millions of Americans. Collectively, the costs associated with obesity ($173 billion), heart disease and stroke ($219 billion), and diabetes ($327 billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. These expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity ‚Äì making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. While individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. Social and economic factors account for 40% of health outcomes, according to public health data. These include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability ‚Äì all of which shape an individual‚Äôs ability to maintain good health. The physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (10%), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for 20% and 30%, respectively. This breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. ‚ÄúIt is better to prevent than to cure. ‚Äì Ibn Sina‚Äù The encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable ‚Äì and, in many cases, reversible. Early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. A variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. Take, for instance, the initiative led by Cigna Healthcare in partnership with Virgin Pulse. By allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. Statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. Families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. The impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. Addressing cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a moral imperative ‚Äì it‚Äôs an economic one. Companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. On a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. Much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. Healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. Integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. The stakes are enormous. Cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a set of disconnected health problems ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of American life, from families to workplaces to entire communities. This is not a challenge we can address piecemeal or delay for another generation. If we fail to act, millions will continue to face shortened lives, mounting medical bills, and preventable suffering. We‚Äôve seen what coordinated action can do in the face of major health threats like cancer or heart disease. It‚Äôs time to bring that same urgency and focus to cardiodiabesity. The longer we wait, the more lives and resources we lose to a crisis that we already know how to address. This isn‚Äôt just about statistics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about people, families, and futures that don‚Äôt have to be cut short. The responsibility to address this crisis can no longer be postponed. -- -- 1 CEO and Founder of Nudge Health Visit us atwww.mynudgehealth.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

      "The lost art of finding your own Food For me foraging is a fascination. Growing up in the UK, I was led to believe that interesting food was ‚Äòexotic‚Äô food. Tropical fruit, spicy curries, fragrant broths. But discovering that the UK is home to some seasonal delicacies ‚Äî free of charge, and, for the most part easy to identify and pick safely, sparked my imagination.

This is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to people‚Äôs questions and concerns about foraging. But, while the ancient practices around finding and identifying edible plants has been all but lost in many communities, there is a group of people who have made it their mission to preserve the knowledge by learning, recording and teaching about the art of hunting for wild food in the UK.

Alcohol has been around forever and will be around for a long time. Some people are able to drink a glass occasionally for celebration and many people can not. Those are the people who I see as an addiction nurse. People who suffer from trauma, and pain, got into the notion of covering the pain by drinking alcohol to numb the painful memories. I had seen people become addicted to alcohol as a child as they were given regular drinks by parents, aunts, abusers, and more. A devastating cycle. I believe everyone deserves a chance to get out of addiction. I believe addiction is not a choice. People can easily get lost in the path down on the addiction road and can find it very difficult to get out. Many people drink socially feeling they need to do so to follow the societal norm. I am one of those people who does not follow the crowd when it comes to alcohol consumption. I have lost too many friends, family, and patients because of alcohol.

      "We have all heard the saying countless times, ‚ÄúMONEY IS THE ROOT OF EVIL.‚Äù This is often misquoted from the actual saying, ‚ÄúTHE LOVE OF MONEY IS THE ROOT OF EVIL.‚Äù People use the former quote to see all people who are rich or wealthy as evil. They use this as an excuse to say why they don‚Äôt work to be financially free. They use this as an excuse to say they are remaining humble. They use this as an excuse to say why they are stagnant in life. They continuously lie to themselves and others around them. People who look at the wealthy and envy them don‚Äôt realize they are envious because they themselves love money and want it for themselves. People who judge the wealthy don‚Äôt realize they themselves would choose to be wealthy if given the chance. I do not say that some wealthy people didn‚Äôt achieve that by wrong and immoral means, which shows their love for money, but those who put God first and work hard for years to get to where they are are blatantly and ignorantly grouped into this single category of ‚Äúall the rich are evil.‚Äù Their hard work, their sacrifices, their losses ‚Äî are all ignored. Some people put themselves first as the reason for chasing wealth, while others put those around them as their reason. Some people look at the world and want to do better for their family, their loved ones, and those less fortunate around them, and so they do not fall in love with the money itself, but with the potential it has to do great things for those around them. Being unwealthy doesn‚Äôt make you better in any way than someone who is. What matters truly is your heart.

      "Access to birth control is the touchstone of reproductive health and personal autonomy, yet it remains highly divisive across societies. Public control over access to birth control is the ability of every individual to obtain advanced contraception without cost, stigma, or the effect of restrictive laws. But the whole need has now come to the forefront for public debate again due to recent political and social developments. Family planning, education, and economic stability dot an individual‚Äôs pathway to health through birth control. Studies proved that contraception access significantly mitigates unintended pregnancies and improves maternal and child health outcomes. Millions yet face hurdles when accessing birth control, which is ironic considering merchandise that holds such great benefits. Economic inequality, inadequate health infrastructure, and barriers to sociopolitical factors are preventers of section marginalized communities from accessing contraceptive service. Public control here is calling for policies catering to equality that‚Äôs priority for accessibility. Governments should subsidize funding into such programs, promote comprehensive sex education, as well as fight against stigma at birth control. This also has to relate with legal protection towards preventing the rollback of reproductive rights, which is yet another issue fast growing across certain regions.

      "Why Parents Should Include Their Children In Organized Sports It‚Äôs important that parents put their kids in organized sports while growing up as it has many benefits such as maintaining strong health, heightened concentration in school, as well as psychological and social benefits as they progress into adulthood. I can vouch that sports have shaped the person I am today and helped me overcome the obstacles I encountered while growing up. When my parents separated and went through the divorce process, sports were a pivotal outlet for me. It was an area of freedom and fun away from my outside life. As a young adult who has suffered from anxiety and depression since I was thirteen due to the things happening with my family, I can say without a doubt that sports saved me. Many of my fondest memories and accomplishments came from being in sports, like scoring the game winning goal with thirty-one seconds left my junior year to be crowned the league champions with my soccer team. I don‚Äôt get the best moment of my life without organized sports. For starters, physical activity helps maintain strong health. Exercising is one of the best ways to keep children in shape and to help prevent diseases and illnesses. (National Institutes of Health, 2016). Studies showed that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of injuries, different types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer, as well as reducing risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure. The American Journal of Preventive Medicine said after school physical programs have reduced obesity the most. Having your kids stay active would help reduce lower medical care as they would be healthier more often which also results in less financial burdens. As mothers and fathers, one of your main goals in life is to always keep your kids safe, and having kids in organized sports keeps your kids healthy which helps towards that goal. Kids participating in organized sports growing up have shown to translate into benefits in the learning environment. A study that followed children from kindergarten to fourth grade showed that physical activities help children to develop and improve their cognitive skills. It has been associated with children getting better grades and doing better on standardized tests. Physical activity has also been shown to improve attitudes and academic behavior including ‚Äúenhanced concentration and attention‚Äù (GAO, 2012). Sports have always motivated me to have higher concentration in my academics to make sure I maintained solid grades. My parents would not allow me to participate in my sports if my grades weren‚Äôt good. That extra incentive while growing up helped me especially in middle school to stay focused and committed to getting good grades. Those good grades alongside sports helped me get admitted into a selective prep high school. Studies on the high school age group showed that teenagers who participated in sports are more likely to attend college and get degrees than non-athletes. Studies have shown that sports can have beneficial effects on individuals even into their adulthoods, which explained that the benefits extend into the workplace. A survey of 400 female corporate executives found that 94% played a sport growing up and 61% said it beneficially impacted their career success. (EY Women Athletes Business Network/espnW, 2014). Additionally, physical activity has also been proven to have a positive impact on mental health and social skills. Kids who are involved in physical activity have reported to have more excitement, more happiness and motivation in their day to day lives, whereas kids who are inactive reported greater nervousness, anxiety, depression, and worry. Physical activity has been shown to boost self-esteem, leadership, and goal-setting skills. A 2019 study found that children who reported to have no physical activity in their life were twice as likely to have mental health issues. According to the United Nations, sports have been proven to provide a safe environment and community for many participants. They may be having trouble at school or having issues at home. Organized sports have helped kids find an outlet from their everyday lives. It helps unite these kids to learn how to work together in a manner that also teaches them to learn the value of teamwork and respect. Additionally, it helps teach children at a young age to develop a passion for something. I fell in love with soccer and basketball when I was three. I developed many of the friendships and relationships I hold dear to this day. The community I fostered at a young age never faltered. I still reach out to old coaches I have had in the past for advice and guidance. I still keep in touch with old teammates and all of us wish each other success and happiness whenever we see one another accomplishing the goals we set when we were younger. I acknowledge that organized sports as the years progress the cost to participate also increases. There‚Äôs a fee for equipment, travel cost, hotel and food. My parents paid for me to play club soccer from age ten to eighteen. Countless practices and games. Many tournaments required us to travel to different states. Different jerseys, shorts, and socks each and every year. I agree that it can add up. When I spoke to my parents, I had asked them if they regretted any of it and they said no. They were just proud of where their daughter is today.

      "There‚Äôs a weight that settles deep within you, one that no amount of sleep seems to lift. You try to rest, to let go, but the moment you close your eyes, the thoughts come rushing in.Did I do enough today? Did I say the right thing? What about tomorrow?It‚Äôs like trying to swim in quicksand ‚Äî the harder you fight, the deeper you sink. Rest isn‚Äôt just lying down; it‚Äôs surrendering, and for some of us, surrender feels dangerous. The silence of stillness can be deafening, amplifying all the doubts and fears we‚Äôve spent the day trying to drown out. We tell ourselves we‚Äôll rest later, after we‚Äôve done more, fixed more, achieved more. But later never comes, and the exhaustion grows, until even the idea of rest feels impossible. Somewhere along the way, we learned to equate rest with laziness, with failure.If you stop, you‚Äôll fall behind.If you rest, you‚Äôre weak.These lies become our truth, and we wear our exhaustion like a badge of honor, proof that we‚Äôre working hard, trying hard, living hard. But deep down, we know the truth: we‚Äôre breaking. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôve convinced yourself that your worth is tied to how much you do, how much you give, how much you endure. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôre afraid of what might surface in the quiet ‚Äî the fears you‚Äôve buried, the grief you‚Äôve ignored, the parts of yourself you‚Äôve been too scared to face. Just like your heart needs a beat of silence between every pulse, you need moments to pause, to breathe, to simply exist without expectation. Rest isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness; it‚Äôs an act of courage. It‚Äôs saying,I choose to care for myself, even when the world tells me I shouldn‚Äôt. And yes, it‚Äôs terrifying. Slowing down feels like losing control. But control is an illusion anyway. The world will keep spinning whether you‚Äôre running yourself into the ground or taking a moment to recover. The difference is, when you choose rest, you give yourself a chance to heal, to rebuild, to carry on without breaking completely. So, if you feel like you can‚Äôt stop ‚Äî stop anyway. Not forever, not all at once, but for a moment. Let the world wait. Let the guilt scream and the doubts whisper. Sit with them. Breathe through them. And remind yourself of this truth:you are not your productivity. Your value isn‚Äôt measured by how much you give to others but by the fact that you are here, alive, trying. Even if rest feels impossible now, it‚Äôs not. Start small ‚Äî a breath, a pause, a moment of stillness. You deserve to be whole, not just what‚Äôs left after everyone else has taken their share. You deserve peace, even when the world doesn‚Äôt offer it freely. And most of all, you deserve rest ‚Äî because you‚Äôve carried enough for today. -- -- Navigating mental health, and something about growth.

I am just now healthy enough to write about it. I am not going to shut up about it, because food safety will only get worse under this next administration. Until I am dead, I will not be silenced. Hello Ms. Xxxxxx, I received your information from Xssss Xssssssss, a colleague of yours. He thought you would be the person to direct this story. On August 5th, 2024, my husband and I contracted foodborne botulism. After a night of violent vomiting and other gastrointestinal distress, things turned worse. Within hours, I lost the use of my legs and had shortness of breath. My husband was vomiting as well and had double vision and we were both slurring our words. Something deathly was wrong. We called my brother-in-law, a hospitalist MD out of Xxxxxxx, and he said to go to the emergency room immediately. My father-in-law from Xxxxxxx happened to be in the area visiting his sister and took my husband to Community North. We called an ambulance for me because I couldn‚Äôt move and was gasping for air. We believe we were diagnosed with botulism in a timely manner because we went in together. By all looks of things, my husband, a fifty-year-old, looked like he was having a stroke. What we conjecture is that his symptoms along with my descending paralysis from the head down was how they caught it. By then, the paralysis had reached my diaphragm and I could no longer breathe on my own. By the Grace of God and excellent medical care, a doctor recognized our combined symptoms as botulism. There is a test for botulism, and that takes four days. I think without intervention, I would have been dead within hours. The doctor called the CDC and an anti-toxin was flown in from Chicago. The anti-toxin was administered, and we lived. My husband left the hospital, walking with a cane breathing on his own, in three weeks. My exposure must have been more extreme because I was a lot sicker. After two days of struggling to breath, I was intubated after what can only be categorized as a near death experience. I later had a tracheostomy and breathed through a tube in my neck for eight weeks. It took me a full twelve weeks to recover from the paralysis to walk and talk again. It has been five months, and I still have to walk with a walker. That is one heck of a story, right? So why is our case on the CDC or Indiana Health Department‚Äôs website? I called the Indiana Health Department and they said there has to be at least ten cases in order for it to be worthy of public record. Two cases of botulism are two cases too many. I understand because of HIPPA, that my anonymity is paramount, but so is public health. I am willing to out myself to bring attention to this deadly, but treatable disease. Yes, botulism is rare and only deadly in five percent of cases, if it is caught in time. Many of my doctors and nurses said they haven‚Äôt seen a botulism case in twenty years. That doesn‚Äôt mean that there were unreported botulism because it was not diagnosed in time. Undiagnosed botulism looks like heart failure or unexplained pnemonia. I was lucky and healthy enough to recover. I was lucky to have insurance and to live in Indianapolis with access to top notch health centers like Community North and Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana (RHI). I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to have the forty pounds to lose in two months. I had no underlying conditions. You change one factor, and I‚Äôm dead of suffocation or heart failure in the first twenty-four hours, or I‚Äôm dead of pneumonia in two weeks. I am a miracle of luck and medical science, and no one outside of my inner circle knows about it. I want everyone to know about it. Our food supply chain is already shaky because of monopolies, and I fear with the incoming administration and the overturning of the Chevron decision that essentially weakened Federal agencies, such as the FDA, things will get worse. If my ordeal can make a difference, I am willing to forgo my anonymity for healthcare providers, legislators, and the public to know how to protect themselves when dinner turns deadly. I am looking forward to speaking with you. Sincerely, M*** K***** Botulism Survivor -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",
      "With around ‚Öì of the child population overweight or obese and 40% unable to read at a basic level, I think we can all agree that good health and academic optimization are two things America needs more of (Fiorenzi;Literacy Statistics 2022‚Äì2023). What if I were to tell you that there is a simple action that American schools can take that addresses both health complications and academic hardships? Well, I hope you‚Äôre on the edge of your seat because I want you to get out of it. That‚Äôs right‚Äì stand up, as my research has led me to believe that the solution is standing! American schools should transition to sit-to-stand desks to take advantage of the plethora of benefits to standing instead of sitting, ranging from hindering health issues like diabetes and ADHD to cultivating academic success by improving mood and averting hours of unproductivity. Tens of thousands of hours of every American‚Äôs life is spent at school, and 65‚Äì70% of this time is spent sitting down (Leech;Prepwise).Sitting is the new smoking, you might have heard, and this claim is backed by findings linking health complications such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease to sedentary time (Fiorenzi). Fortunately, standing desks, being on the path to movement, aids in combating each of such complications. Standing burns more calories than sitting, averaging an additional 50 calories per hour in adults, and studies have shown that obese or overweight children burn even more than their healthy-weight peers (Fiorenzi). Standing has been found to reduce blood sugar spikes after meals, a benefit especially helpful for diabetics but good for everyone since ‚Äúgreater amplitudes of glycemic variability have been linked to circulatory oxidative stress‚Äù (Jubbal). Standing is also connected with better heart health, as a study consisting of sitting and standing bus drivers observed that the standing drivers‚Äô risk for heart disease was half of that of the sitting drivers (Leech). If standing were to become the social norm, both the physiological perks and a new social pressure to be healthy enough to stand for longer periods would hinder health complications in the American school population. Consistent with the correlation between better health and academic achievement, sit-to-stand desks provide users with a better learning experience by optimizing key factors to academic success, including productivity, mood, and attention (Kurniawan;Schmidt;Valiente). One of the more obvious perks of a standing desk is postural improvement; good posture naturally reduces back, neck and sciatica pain (Leech). According to astudy, patients suffering from chronic pain had an average reduction of 9.8 hours of work productivity per week. I‚Äôm not sure about you, but I can learn quite a lot in almost 10 hours. A lesser known perk of a standing desk is its effect on mood: a positive one to be more specific. In one study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue and 87% reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day and after returning to sitting desks their moods reverted to their original levels (Leech). This study complements other research finding sitting and sedentary lifestyles linked with increased risks of depression and anxiety (Leech). As a student, I can attest that maintaining a positive outlook has pushed me to take risks that have led to my own academic success. Although you might have expected that standing desks would create distraction for children, I have found far more evidence suggesting just the opposite. I acknowledge that there is some anecdotal evidence documenting young children bumping into one another while using standing desks, however, recall that chairs create similar distractions including rocking, footsie, and leg swinging (‚ÄúThe Effects of Standing Desks‚Äù). On the other hand, one study demonstrated that students using standing desks exhibited ‚Äúsignificant improvements in attention and inhibitory control compared to their sitting peers,‚Äù and schoolchildren in the experiment group of another study that used standing-desks were found to be between 12 and 25% more engaged than the control group (Fiorenzi;Otto). Dr. Mark Benden of Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health explains this finding well: ‚ÄúWhen kids sit at a desk all day, they don‚Äôt have to use any energy, which means they can just as easily fall asleep, daydream, or distract themselves by distracting others‚Äù (Fiorenzi). At least for me, it ismuchharder to fall asleep standing up. Considering that standing expends more energy than sitting, it‚Äôs logical that distraction would be reduced, a boon particularly for millions of American children diagnosed with ADD or ADHD (Fiorenzi). Hopefully at this point, you‚Äôre convinced that standing desks have immense benefits. You may still be wondering, though, is it worth the effort to replace all sitting desks with standing desks? Allow me to clarify what I mean by ‚Äútransitioning to sit-to-stand desks.‚Äù It‚Äôd be a waste to toss out perfectly adequate sitting desks already owned, but I do think that when schools are in the market for new desks, they should purchase sit-to-stand desks. Sit-to-stand desks allow users to adjust the height of the desk, giving them the option to sit or stand, thereby taking into consideration the needs of physically disabled children and providing flexibility for various activities. Lastly, whereas the monetary price of sit-to-stand desks might be slightly more than that of a sitting-only desk, having the ability to make use of the numerous, substantial advantages of standing sure seem to outweigh that small cost differential. If you believe in having a healthy, educated population, I urge you to use your influence as a student, parent, teacher, staff member, administrator, or alumni to advocate for sit-to-stand desks in your school.

      "Modern medicine has made incredible strides in helping people live longer. But researchers aren‚Äôt just focused on adding years ‚Äî they‚Äôre looking to extend health alongside lifespan. A recent study offers a glimpse into what may be possible: combining two FDA-approved drugs,trametinibandrapamycin, resulted in a significant lifespan increase in mice, while also improving their health in old age. Researchers gave one group of mice trametinib, another group rapamycin, and a third group a combination of the two. The results were striking: ‚Ä¢Trametinib aloneextended median lifespan by7%‚Äì10%, depending on sex. ‚Ä¢Rapamycin aloneincreased lifespan by17%‚Äì18%. ‚Ä¢ Thecombination of both drugsshowed the most dramatic effects, boosting lifespan by35% in femalesand27% in males. What‚Äôs more, the maximum lifespan (the longest any mice lived) increased significantly when both drugs were used together, highlighting their additive benefits. Both drugs target different cellular pathways involved in aging: ‚Ä¢Trametinibworks on a pathway that regulates cell growth. ‚Ä¢Rapamycininhibits a pathway linked to inflammation and age-related diseases. By combining these mechanisms, the drugs created a stronger anti-aging effect than either could achieve alone. Extending lifespan is one thing, but how did the micefeelas they aged? Researchers found the drug combo also improved key markers of health: ‚Ä¢Heart health:Delayed age-related decline in heart function. ‚Ä¢Tumors:Reduced tumor growth and overall tumor load. ‚Ä¢Inflammation:Lowered inflammation in the brain and body. However, it wasn‚Äôt all good news. Some mice experienced side effects like fatty liver disease and testicular degeneration, raising questions about how these drugs might work in humans. Both trametinib and rapamycin are FDA-approved, but for very different uses: ‚Ä¢Trametinibtreats certain types of cancer. ‚Ä¢Rapamycinis used after organ transplants to prevent rejection. The fact that these drugs are already approved opens the door for further research into their potential as longevity treatments. However, what works in mice doesn‚Äôt always translate to humans. Animal studies like this are an exciting starting point, but testing in humans could take decades. Scientists are now exploring whether combining even more drugs ‚Äî like diabetes medications metformin and acarbose ‚Äî could create an even stronger anti-aging effect. The goal is to target multiple cellular pathways to not only extend lifespan but also reduce age-related diseases. But before you get too excited, remember: it‚Äôs still early days. While these findings are promising, the path from lab to human trials is long and full of challenges. This study highlights the potential of drug combinations to unlock new frontiers in longevity research. While human applications are still far off, these findings show that targeting multiple aging pathways could be the key to living not just longer, but healthier lives.

      "One evening, it showered outside. My mom grabbed a vessel to collect the rainwater. She ran to the terrace and placed it on the beam. The rain stopped within a few minutes. I eagerly went to take the vessel but ended in dismay. I thought half of the pot would have been filled. Only 5% of the pot has been filled. Anyhow, I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste it. I wondered why we hadn‚Äôt considered tasting the rainwater all these years. I thought drinking rainwater would catch cold for me. I also believed that it would be tasteless or neutral. With all curiosity, I had a sip. Wow‚Ä¶ It was as sweet as the filtered water that we drank every day. It isn‚Äôt similar to that but possesses a unique taste. No water in the world tastes similar to rainwater. We install water purifiers at home to bring that taste. But, God has made it naturally without any water purifiers. His blessing has been instilled in the rainwater. I could drink only a very little as I had to share with my mom and aunt too. My aunt said that one of our neighbours cooks food only with rainwater. My curiosity spikes high to give it a try. -- -- 4 ‚ÄúReaders Club‚Äù is a reader-centered publication that delivers valuable insights across diverse topics.

      "How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

      "Welcome to the future, my friend! You know how we‚Äôve all been talking about robots, self-driving cars, and the AI takeover? Well, 2025 has officially arrived, and AI isn‚Äôt just a buzzword anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs running the show. We‚Äôre not talking about simple tasks anymore; AI is getting morepersonal, morecreative, and even a littleemotional(yes, AI has feelings now, sort of). So buckle up, because this post is about to dive into the quirkiest, most game-changing AI trends of 2025. Let‚Äôs break it down and have some fun while we‚Äôre at it. Okay, picture this: you‚Äôre having a rough day, and your phone ‚Äî without any drama ‚Äî sends you a text that says, ‚ÄúHey, I got your back.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs not your BFF; it‚Äôs Emotional AI. Yes, AI is finally gettingin touchwith its feelings! Emotional AI? It‚Äôs like your AI bestie who knows when you need a pep talk, or maybe just a virtual hug. Generative AI was cool before, but now? Oh boy. AI 2.0 is thecreative geniuswe never knew we needed. This isn‚Äôt just about generating text; we‚Äôre talking full-on art, stories, and even movies ‚Äî no human needed. www.sequoiacap.com Generative AI is no longer the assistant; it‚Äôs thestar of the show. Just wait until you see what it can come up with next. Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî businesses love efficiency. And what‚Äôs more efficient than AI doing all the boring stuff so you can focus onbig ideas? Businesses are waking up to the power of AI, and it‚Äôstotallyreshaping the way things get done. Efficiency is the name of the game, and AI is the MVP. Hold on. While AI is doing some pretty mind-blowing things, we need to keep it in check. Ethical AI is like the parental figure saying, ‚ÄúOkay, but only if you follow the rules.‚Äù And it‚Äôs about time. Ethical AI is the safety net that ensures we use this powerful tool for good, not for‚Ä¶ you know, world domination. (But wearekeeping an eye on that). Wait, did you say AI is helping save the planet? Yep, you heard that right. It‚Äôs not all about robots taking over the world; AI is actually doing its part to keep the Earth from going full-on disaster movie. www.weforum.org AI is like the eco-warrior of the future. But instead of capes, it‚Äôs all about algorithms and sensors. Go, team AI! Alright, so you‚Äôre probably wondering, ‚ÄúHow do I stay ahead of all this tech stuff?‚Äù Simple ‚Äî stay curious, keep learning, and maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî don‚Äôt get on the bad side of AI. We‚Äôre talking about upskilling in AI-related fields, embracing innovation, and using AI as your partner in crime.

      "ON JANUARY 21, 2025 BY PHOTOMOTOMAN IN POLITICAL EDITORIAL Share This! I am a retired Fire Chief, and former educator. For the last 30 years of my 43 year career in the fire service, I attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. It started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. That was 32 years ago. It became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. And throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, CEO‚Äôs, CAO‚Äôs, CFO‚Äôs, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. All ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. For me, my experience first began in earnest in 1989, when fires ravaged northern Manitoba, my province. I was contracted to the Provincial Government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. In my time off from being a full-time firefighter, I trained as SARTEC, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which I acquired privately by training outside the country. I also travelled throughout the North under contract. That year, fires forced the evacuation of 25,000 people across 25 communities. However in 2003, I resigned from my fire department in order to take a Fire Chief‚Äôs position in another Province. I had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in British Columbia where I had been, technically hired. That year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was 54 million dollars. By the end of the summer, the Province of British Columbia had spent 554 million dollars fighting those fires. In the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as I had already resigned my position, I took a position as the Fire Chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in Ontario, Canada in the Region of Niagara. After eight years, I found myself successfully hired as the Fire Chief for a jurisdiction in Alberta, Canada, that surrounded Calgary, Alberta. Within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Provincial Park. The fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. My attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for 150 years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. It is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over 9,000 wells drilled in 2010. I often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? I will never know, but based on what is occurring in Canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. They divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. As my contract ended, and I began a job consulting, in May 2011, a forest fire surrounding Slave Lake, Alberta, home to 7000 people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. The loss amounted to 700 million dollars. Five years later, in May 2016, Fort McMurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of 2,400 structures. The loss amounted to 3.7 billion dollars, just in insured losses. A 2017 study from MacEwan University estimated total losses were in the range of $9 billion dollars. In 2023, Canada‚Äôs most destructive year to date, there were more than 6,000 fires, and 29 mega fires, that burned 41 million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in Canada. Experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. And then this year, Jasper, Alberta, one of the jewels of Canada‚Äôs National Parks saw a fire burn 1,113 structures. None of these occurrences is normal. None of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. They are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, in Lytton, BC, another Canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. The temperatures for the last three years having exceeded 41 C. At some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in Canada in 2021 of 49.2 C or 121 F. This is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. What Does All This Have To Do With Los Angeles? This week Audie Cornish of CNN did a podcast. Her guest was Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist for NASA. His former home, which was destroyed in the Los Angeles community of Altadena, was one of the more than 12,000 homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. Peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, ‚ÄúAs a Climate Scientist, I knew it was time to leave Los Angeles,‚Äù on January 10th, in the New York Times. His personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire 14 years he had lived in Altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to Durham, North Carolina. He did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in Southern California and Nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. And this last week, he was proved right. What is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on Fox and to the incoming President of the United States, a man who hasn‚Äôt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. The problem according to Kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. Less than half of America elected the current President of the United States (49.9%), yet this ‚Äòmandate‚Äô enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. They are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. So, Where is Safe? One of Kalmus‚Äô beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. Not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, 50 years ago, is daunting. Much of what is to come, is baked into our future. Of that, there is certainty. And whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the question remains. Where is safe? Kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. Climate change is global. Obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the United States and Canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. But Ashland, North Carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. So was Lytton, British Columbia. We are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. It will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. And because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. And none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- My name is Ken McMullen. I‚Äôm a retired Director of Emergency Services and former academic.

      "Life is really tough for women, especially those in middle age. Eileen Chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. When they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but there‚Äôs no one they can depend on. Actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. Men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. But that‚Äôs not how it is for women. They carry so much more on their shoulders. They can pick up the weight, but they can‚Äôt put it down. It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work. When all of these things come crashing down at once, a woman will still stand strong, even though she feels totally helpless. Middle-aged women may seem tough, but they still have weaknesses.

      "Even though I am happy in my current relationship, I find that I have some unresolved regrets and baggage from past relationships that are still affecting me.

      "The Heart That Matters By Terri Rimmer Shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment Melody‚Äôs neighbor Samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. Fantastic! She thought. The establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. ‚ÄúYou can just give them $5, and they‚Äôll accept that, if you have it,‚Äù Samantha, who used a wheelchair, told Melody. In a few days they went to lunch there with Samantha‚Äôs granddaughter and Melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. She would be back definitely. Over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay ‚Äî or not. She found out though that they did not want her five dollars. They wanted more and made that clear. Two years prior, Melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldn‚Äôt afford to get another vehicle. Because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. She was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. A friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment Melody couldn‚Äôt do the work. Now she‚Äôd been out of a job for four years, the longest she‚Äôd ever been unemployed. Melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldn‚Äôt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. The other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but Melody‚Äôs injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. The third time Melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something Samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. She found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didn‚Äôt mind, except for this group‚Äôs attitude of entitlement. Melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. She was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. But a professional writer/former pet and house sitter also with 40 years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. Melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. And some would ask her for money which she found laughable. The owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didn‚Äôt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. He gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. This was not the person she was. Now it was Christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough she‚Äôd had over a year that she‚Äôd been on over 19 medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. The allergist had given her the answer she‚Äôd been seeking since last year regarding her condition ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt contagious, it wasn‚Äôt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. Whew! She was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. Others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed Melody. The manager took her name, and she didn‚Äôt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. She couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. No sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. ‚ÄúHi, friend,‚Äù he said insincerely. ‚ÄúYou seem like you don‚Äôt feel well.‚Äù Melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didn‚Äôt believe her. ‚ÄúWell, if you can‚Äôt get that coughing under control you can‚Äôt eat today,‚Äù he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. She thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. The woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. The manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. So, once he walked away Melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldn‚Äôt see it. ‚ÄúI know how it is,‚Äù Melody told the woman. ‚ÄúI was in a group home before.‚Äù So, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. Now Melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. As she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. ‚ÄúHonestly, it doesn‚Äôt get any better than the mission here!‚Äù spouted a customer. -- -- I have 41 years of journalism experience having written for ten newspapers, some magazines, and web sites.

      "In which we land ourselves in physical therapy I have never used spreadsheets in my personal life. I don‚Äôt create budgets, because I know what things cost and I know how much I make and I know how much money I need to have in my bank account on the first of the month. I rarely make lists. I don‚Äôt write down my goals in journals. I don‚Äôt wake up early if I don‚Äôt have to. This ‚ÄúWellness January‚Äù or whatever the hell I‚Äôm having is honestly pretty off-brand.

Here is a list of things that I have quit over the years (that I can remember): And here is a list of things that I have done for a respectable amount of time, to make myself feel better (that I can remember): As I have said before, unless it‚Äôs a necessity, I think life is too short to do things you don‚Äôt want to be doing. Like, people that read a bunch of books just because they want to say they read a certain number of books? Those people concern me. I‚Äôll finish a book if I like it. Some people say that‚Äôs a symptom of attention-deficit disorder, but I say it‚Äôs being human. Friendly reminder that I am not a medical professional or a social media influencer, so I can‚Äôt actually diagnose that. But here we are, 21 days into January. Still going strong on the no-alcohol front. Stilltryingto go strong on the running front. I‚Äôm not really craving alcohol anymore, and I‚Äôm sad that I‚Äôm currently elliptical and can‚Äôt properly run for the time-being. My last run was a treadmill run. My knees and my hip started hurting immediately. But my stubborn ass said, ‚ÄúHaha, no‚Äù and I put on another episode of my zombie thing and kept running. Despite the pain, I can confirm that run #6 sucked quite a bit less than run #1. I was able to do my signature slow-jog for about 15 minutes before I stopped, and I only stopped because I needed water. I even started to zone out a little, and think about other things. But now, in addition to fucking up my hip, I also have pretty constant pain my knees. Since those things are all pretty important, I took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). I know PT is something I need to do because I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. However I would MUCH rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. Ugh. Or RUNNING SHOES. But I‚Äôm making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. Anyway, I now have a PT plan to help with the pain. And even though Iknowit will help me feel better, I will certainly not be excited about doing it. I‚Äôm also an instant gratification human, which is another reason that long-term projects are hard for me. I find myself rushing through writing and rushing through art projects just because I want them to bedone.I try to take shortcuts. I don‚Äôt take the time totrulycrease the origami paper, so my cranes always look wonky. I haven‚Äôt felt very inspired on the writing front lately.

      "Are you also a perfectionist like me? I always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. Under too much pressure to be perfect, I was always an average student because instead of working hard, I kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. This all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. üòî I knew I had to make a change. It wasn‚Äôt an easy process, but I actively decided to find the solution. So, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that I can decide when to stop chasing for it. Learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. In this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve his/her full potential. It‚Äôs the obsession that creates the problem. We just have to know the limits! Do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know it‚Äôs probably unattainable? Why do we do this? Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit. Essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. It encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. From an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently ‚Äòperfect lives' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. The flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. This constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. Nobody likes failing, right? Sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. We always think like, ‚ÄúIf I aim high enough, I‚Äôll minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing‚Äù. This fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. üçÇ The problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. Impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. Furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. Excess of anything is harmful. Our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. We are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. These images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. The pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. Many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. By meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. They may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. The ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. But sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. Also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. For some of us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. We believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. It‚Äôs a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though it‚Äôs often based on flawed assumptions. Many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; it‚Äôs about earning approval and acceptance. -Brene Brown The pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. When we‚Äôre so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. We might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. Ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. Continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. Celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. As Alexander Pope aptly said, ‚Äúto err is human, to forgive divine‚Äù Embrace imperfection and recognize that it‚Äôs a natural part of the human experience. It also helps to reframe our definition of success. Instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. Did we learn something new? Did we overcome a challenge? Those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasn‚Äôt \"perfect.\" Ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. By embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives.

      "Imagine you're sitting in a doctor's office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: \"You have cancer.\" It's shocking. Every day, 60,000 people face this same unexpected reality. Most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: \"I felt perfectly healthy.\" They didn't realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. I have some terrible news: You have a1 in 5 chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. But wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. But here's the catch: It's far more complicated than it seems. Even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting I've performed. And despite all our training and research ‚Äî doctors still don't fully understand cancer. Cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. Cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. Cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body's defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine's biggest challenges. At its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. Depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. The real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don't follow the rules. Usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body's police force ‚Äî your immune system ‚Äî and removed. Even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: Now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body's defences. This buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. Initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. As the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. When the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. My colleagues and I can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. Still, that's precisely for situations I'm getting paid for, and I like it. But here's where it gets tricky: Cancer cells have a unique ability ‚Äî they can take highways through your body to spread. This process is calledmetastasis. There are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: At this point, treatment becomes more complicated. Surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. Usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. Metastasis no longer means the end ‚Äî it just means the treatment needs more personalization. But the big question remains. Damage occurs when the cell's DNA is altered. Cell DNA acts as the user manual for how your cell works. When that manual is damaged, the cell develops DNA mutations, which cause it to malfunction. There are two ways a cell can get damaged: Purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. It's like receiving an altered manual the moment you're born. Cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of DNA damage. Sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. Cancers show up much later. Bad habits usually cause this type of DNA mutation. For example (to name a few): Those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell's DNA, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. Usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. But cancer cells are smarter than you think. The more damage a cell accumulates, the more its DNA gets altered. Cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. Remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. It can now: It's like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. And here is how they do it. Cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body's defences: Yes. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. But there's an even better approach: The best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. Early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. Cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. Your health is worth it.

The partnership will begin with a $100 billion investment and start its first project ‚Äî a data center in Texas. The plan is to expand to other states over time.

Stargate aims to create cutting-edge infrastructure to support AI development in the U.S. While spokespeople for SoftBank and OpenAI have not commented, this massive initiative signals a strong push to position the U.S. as a leader in AI technology.

I appreciate the funding, but when you have the power to drive innovation and lack the core fundamentals of human life and the struggles of humankind, it feels like a disconnect. I wish they could have given a more detailed approach to the agenda and prioritized what AI innovations could have benefited the people most, like healthcare, education, or energy. Some of the most crucial AI innovations that could significantly benefit humanity: First, you‚Äôll need to install the required libraries: For this example, we‚Äôll use a dataset of medical images (you can use datasets likeBreast Cancer HistopathologyorChest X-rayfrom Kaggle).

      "There are advantages to being on autopilot. I get out of bed when the alarm goes off, I deal with the pet, I check the coffee machine and make my coffee, it drips into my cup whilst I wash the dishes. It‚Äôs the same thing every single morning. I don‚Äôt think, I just do it. By the time I‚Äôve been awake for 10 minutes, my systems have rebooted, and any fog has cleared. If I‚Äôd stopped to think this morning before throwing myself down the length of my bed to turn off my alarm, I might have felt hungry. Hunger has so far surprised me with it‚Äôs absence. The milkshake maker I purchased for this fat loss journey hasn‚Äôt been used to make a single meal replacement shake. Instead I poured warm milk into it, added a teaspoon of chocolate powder, dropped in the whisk ball and shook the whole thing vigorously until it was smooth, with a head of foam. That was my daughters hot chocolate, I wake her up with a drink every morning. On the periphery of my awareness as I did all of this, hovered the desire to have one of my meal replacement shakes, and a spectre of worry that lack of fuel might trigger a headache and make it hard to hit my target at work. I was undecided, but they both left, like two people tired of waiting for a bus on a cold morning. -- -- 3 BSc Psychology. Author of Myshi Moo and the Frightening Face.

      "Ongoing virus for decades has resulted in a spillover of different animals. According to theCDC, since 1997, there have been 970 human infections in 24 countries; around 50% have been fatal. Since 2022, there‚Äôs been less than 100 cases. In March 2024, the US reported their first flu detection in Dairy Cows. This is Michael and let‚Äôs get into it. The cases of bird flu have been mostly from U.S. dairy and poultry workers. Animals like dairy cattle, wild birds, poultry flocks, and different mammals, like cats and bears, have detected the flu. There has been no person-to-person spread and the public health risk is low; with only 67 confirmed cases in the US. However, there was one person who recently died from the bird flu. On January 6, 2025, the Louisiana Department of Health announced that since December, there‚Äôs been one patient who has been hospitalized from the bird flu. That patient was the first to die in the US. Samples were taken from the patient and it turns out that the virus mutated after the infection.

      "Abortion has always been a topic of heated debate in the United States and is still full of contention and emotion. On a fundamental level, it sets women's right to decide on their body against the moral area that deals with questions like, \"When does life start?\"\" Abortion is the right to conclude about one's own body even three times over, while, on the other hand, it is the right to morals and the legality of the act of abortion. Critics, who tend to liken it to legalizing murder, may press their point about the disparity to characterize that provisional empowerment is the wrong method for managing the situation. The US history of abortion rights is characterized by significantly changing laws. The ruling, Roe v. Wade, that was in 1973 was the primary one that made women in the US have legal rights to abortion. Privacy and bodily autonomy were mentioned in the case to signify these rights, which are the main foundation. This case, however, was not valid after it was changed in 2022 by Dobbs v.

      "The idea of a global health organization predates the establishment of theWHO. In the late 19th century, international efforts to combat diseases like cholera and yellow fever laid the groundwork for cooperation across borders. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the aftermath of World War II that global leaders recognized the need for a central organization to address health issues on a worldwide scale. TheWHOwas officially established on April 7, 1948, a date now celebrated annually as World Health Day. With 61 countries signing its constitution, the WHO marked the beginning of a unified approach to tackling global health challenges. The WHO‚Äôs vision is ambitious yet simple: ‚ÄúHealth for All.‚Äù This encapsulates its mission to ensure that all people have access to essential healthcare services without suffering financial hardship. Its objectives include: The WHO emphasizes collaboration, working with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders to achieve its goals. TheWorld Health Organization‚Äôs work spans a broad spectrum of activities aimed at improving global health. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key functions: The WHO develops guidelines and standards that influence health practices worldwide. For example, it publishes the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a critical tool for tracking and diagnosing diseases. The WHO plays a pivotal role in eradicating and controlling infectious diseases. Its notable successes include the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and its ongoing efforts to eliminate polio. The organization also leads campaigns against malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, providing funding, resources, and technical expertise. During health crises such as pandemics, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks, the WHO steps in to coordinate international responses. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO distributed over 1 billion doses of vaccines through the COVAX initiative, saving countless lives. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are leading causes of death globally. The WHO advocates for preventive measures, such as reducing tobacco use, encouraging physical activity, and promoting healthy diets. The WHO is committed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. Through programs like the Every Woman Every Child initiative, it ensures better access to prenatal care, safe childbirth, and nutrition for mothers and children. Recognizing mental health as an integral part of overall well-being, the WHO works to destigmatize mental illness and improve access to mental health services. Its global mental health action plan emphasizes the need for early intervention and support systems. One of the WHO‚Äôs most celebrated accomplishments is the eradication of smallpox. Through a coordinated vaccination campaign, the disease was officially declared eradicated in 1980, saving millions of lives. Although polio remains endemic in a few regions, the WHO‚Äôs Global Polio Eradication Initiative has brought the world closer to eradicating this crippling disease. For example, cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988. The WHO has been instrumental in the fight against HIV/AIDS. By advocating for antiretroviral therapy and prevention programs, it has significantly reduced the disease‚Äôs impact in many countries.Read More -- -- <a href=\"https://www.myreview24.com/\"> Read Movie Reviews, Entertainment News, Home & Kitchen, Net Worth, News, Trending Topics, Fashion and more</a> Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

What has the Decade achieved? At this halfway point, businesses and governments have an opportunity to partner even more closely to address the global megatrend of aging ‚Äî a phenomenon so powerful and incontrovertible it‚Äôs reshaping our world. It requires consideration in strategic plans in every sector, and yet is still too often overlooked. Today, more than 2 billion people are aged 55 and older, doubling by mid-century. However, perhaps more consequentially, steeply declining birth rates are leading to depopulation, which, in combination with increased longevity, means societies have more old than young around the world. It‚Äôs an unprecedented demographic shift, the impact of which rivals that of the industrial revolution or the advent of the internet and all the technology that followed.

Work and retirement.We also need to rethink how and how long people work. The traditional retirement ages of 60 or 65 no longer make sense in a world with fewer young workers and longer, healthier lives. Employers who want to win must find ways toattract and retain older employees, even into their 80s. This is especially urgent in OECD countries, where aging populations and declining birth rates are changing the workforce landscape dramatically.

Treasuring thefirsttime seeing the result of his labor from whacking thick pods with a knife and piling the milky beans in a heap before drying later for shipment, an older guy, as he sat among workers, mostly in flip-flops and dingy shirts, held the unwrapped chocolate bar up to talk, basking in his moment of glory. Impatiently, their hands reached out until he mentioned his obligation as the eldest to taste what the stranger had given him. When he finally indulged himself, the sweetness immediately spread across his lips into a smile. Earlier, another laborer, prompted by a flashing notion, had shared what he thought with others, one of several comments the group associated with eating chocolate. ‚ÄúThis is why white people are so healthy.‚Äù Saving the wrapper in his pocket after passing the rest to others, the eldest there declared that he would take it home to show to his family, so proud of his discovery of chocolate, a delicacy forcenturiesin many parts of the world, especially oncecompaniespoured in enough milk and sugar to keep dentists and physicians in business, as patients succumbed to cavities and a litany of diseases from obesity. Count me as one of the many who enjoyed those delectable desires sweetened for addiction. Switching over gradually to the kind without any added sweetness took years before I got used to the taste. Even now, I chase that bitterness down with a banana or a pinch of raisins and constantly keep an eye on the scale, adjusting daily desires by the ounce, because I treasure good health. Otherwise, I‚Äôd eat up a few sizes from all the frigid temperatures that have kept me in this season. Jazzed bysnow, the most, from what I read online, since Valentine‚Äôs of 1895, Fat Tuesday came early for strollers in New Orleans, as unseemly weather shut down the city, while also giving mothers a reason to celebrate with their kids who, like that guy tasting chocolate first, smiled wide at the sight of soft mounds piling atop cars and layering lawns everywhere ‚Äî a memory imprinted forever in a treasured click for a photo album, adding to the joy from a day off from schoolwork. First times, as well as final ones, occupy a special place that we embrace more emotionally than whatever happened before or afterward ‚Äî whether in a tasted desire or prized memory. Memories of those first moments often last throughout life, adding layers of context for comparison as we mature and grow through the years. Once we add similar moments, that original impression slowly depreciates until it loses its luster, the charm of what made it precious in the first place. Eyes that once dazzled look elsewhere now at a dinner table. Instead of connecting deeply to refresh the feeling that we promised to hold on to forever, we slip into going through the motions of just another habit ‚Äî a hug without meaning more, just another piece of chocolate for our lips. Valentine‚Äôs Day, as well as a couple of other days throughout the year, particularly the annual sale of Leonidas Chocolate, usually brings on an urge for me to resist perhaps my favorite temptation for a delicacy. However, a frozen winter of singleness has one advantage going for it ‚Äî buying less processed chocolate to sprinkle in for a random occasion, especially with fewer bouquets of scented petals that wilt by the week. Despite missing out on delectable treats that whet my appetite each year, I manage to flavor bitter nibs daily and savor them with fruit to suit my taste. Consequently, I refresh an edible joy that keeps me coming back for more each day, though rather hard-pressed to remember that first taste of chocolate ever. If I reacted similarly to the man in the video after that first bite of chocolate, my impression faded quickly amid sweetness packaged on shelves easily within reach, perhaps in preparing me for a world filled with irresistible eye candy often painted on lips. This morning‚Äôs reading treasures wisdom that knows which desires mean more and which pleasures require greater self-discipline. Each day, we encounter a new opportunity to improve on the day before or just drift back to the pack of mediocrity ‚Äî that first nibble for a taste of what lies ahead or fresh snow for a memory in years to come.

      "Digital health startups are obsessed with technology, but what if the real competitive edge lies in skills that can‚Äôt be coded? In an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ‚Äî AI-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. Yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasn‚Äôt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. Many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. After all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary AI model is what attracts funding and headlines. But here‚Äôs the catch: digital health is not just about technology; it‚Äôs about people. Whether it‚Äôs convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. In fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô side of the business. To be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. A leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. However, technology alone can‚Äôt explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. It‚Äôs the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. Think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? Or one who can design a wearable but can‚Äôt address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? In digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. Technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but it‚Äôs time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code. Communication, empathy, and relationship-building are not optional ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential.

Eventually the cherries made their way to the US and then prohibition happened. in the 1920s, a professor in Oregon created his own version using calcium salts and brine as a preservative, which removed the coloring, so he added back coloring, artificially, giving them their bright red color. This colorant was banned in the 60s for causing cancer, so manufacturers started using another artificial colorant ‚Äî Red 40, which also causes cancer and neurological issues in humans. Red 40 is still used today in Maraschino cherries and many other foods and drinks and cosmetics. Let‚Äôs review. I am going to make this short and sweet. Just like us, large organizations, governments, charities, corporations also want self preservation, but the want it for the ‚Äúorganizations‚Äù interest aka the shareholders/stakeholders. They may employ humans like you and me, but they employ them to work on their behalf. Why do humans comply? The paycheck they receive serves their own self-interests enough to make them do things they know are not benefiting others. Nothing will change until we demand it. Power is never given back, and rarely is money. If we want to take our power back, we need to take power away from entities who are not protecting us. Growth is not in the ‚Äúbig‚Äù it is found in small, local community efforts where everyone has a say. But even community boards suffer from power trips. We need a system that is easily accessible and readily available to all, to share their voice and be a part of the final decision This won‚Äôt happen how we do it now. We ALL have to work and get involved. We have to read, do research. Social media is not research. Learn to read a medical study. We have to stop looking for a knight in shining armor to save us and also stop looking for it in the same places. The news, the politicians, the experts, the influencers, the pod casters are all geared to grab your interest, your wallet, your trust, your vote. Want to find real leaders? People who will represent us? People who actually will do the right thing? Find the people who aren‚Äôt influenced by money or power.

      "Imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. A world where individuals don‚Äôt spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like Huntington‚Äôs disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. A world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. This is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. But alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. A dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where CRISPR places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. While genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. In 2018,Chinese scientist He Jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to HIV, resulting in the birth of twin girls(Raposo). Globally,42.3 million people have died from HIV, yet with CRISPR, no more have to (‚ÄúHIV‚Äù). While this trial showcased gene editing‚Äôs revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.The experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(‚ÄúWhat are the Ethical Concerns‚Ä¶?‚Äù). A clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. But what happens when scientific experimentation isn‚Äôt strictly monitored? In the cases of theTuskegee Syphilis Study,Henrietta Lacks,Nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: Catastrophe. This same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of Nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. What happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? Prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them ‚Äî a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. Evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.A 2018 study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens‚Äô adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(Agha et al.). Narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. However, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. This technology could end generations of suffering.Genome mutations cause roughly 7,000 known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (‚ÄúUsing gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases‚Äù). CRISPR technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as Huntington‚Äôs disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable ‚Äîcurrent treatment costs of $2.2 million reflect the high expense of novel technologies‚Äî it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (Pagliarulo and Lucas). Unfortunately, humans won‚Äôt stop at disease eradication. If we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldn‚Äôt we? Enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. Targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. Take theCCR5-Œî32 mutation, which Chinese scientist He Jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(Sanders). This mutation prohibits HIV infection, yetincreases susceptibility to West Nile virus and leads to a 21% higher overall mortality rate(Sanders). This is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. Eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. Additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(‚ÄúAccelerating Global Access to Gene Therapies‚Äù). While disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. Enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. What may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. Such pursuits are simply indefensible. What is the true cost of progress? When ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? Well, let‚Äôs review a familiar example. What did He Jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? Prison. Reckless application of CRISPR technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. But on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? If genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist ‚Äî it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.The World Health Organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(‚ÄúHealth Ethics & Governance‚Äù). Without enforcement, these measures are futile. CRISPR holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. But if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. This isn‚Äôt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. As a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing? The choice ‚Äî and the responsibility ‚Äî belongs to all of us.

      "In discussions about America‚Äôs most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. Yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. This complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. It‚Äôs a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Research by Evernorth reveals a startling statistic: 93% of adults in the United States suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. This figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. The rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. Between 1999 and 2020, adult obesity rates soared from 30.5% to 41.9%. If current trends persist, half of all American adults could be classified as obese by 2030. But this is far from a superficial issue ‚Äì it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of $719 billion annually. To put this into perspective, consider Sarah, a 45-year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. Her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. Over time, she developed type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. Sarah‚Äôs story mirrors that of millions of Americans. Collectively, the costs associated with obesity ($173 billion), heart disease and stroke ($219 billion), and diabetes ($327 billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. These expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity ‚Äì making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. While individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. Social and economic factors account for 40% of health outcomes, according to public health data. These include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability ‚Äì all of which shape an individual‚Äôs ability to maintain good health. The physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (10%), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for 20% and 30%, respectively. This breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. ‚ÄúIt is better to prevent than to cure. ‚Äì Ibn Sina‚Äù The encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable ‚Äì and, in many cases, reversible. Early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. A variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. Take, for instance, the initiative led by Cigna Healthcare in partnership with Virgin Pulse. By allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. Statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. Families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. The impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. Addressing cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a moral imperative ‚Äì it‚Äôs an economic one. Companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. On a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. Much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. Healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. Integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. The stakes are enormous. Cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a set of disconnected health problems ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of American life, from families to workplaces to entire communities. This is not a challenge we can address piecemeal or delay for another generation. If we fail to act, millions will continue to face shortened lives, mounting medical bills, and preventable suffering. We‚Äôve seen what coordinated action can do in the face of major health threats like cancer or heart disease. It‚Äôs time to bring that same urgency and focus to cardiodiabesity. The longer we wait, the more lives and resources we lose to a crisis that we already know how to address. This isn‚Äôt just about statistics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about people, families, and futures that don‚Äôt have to be cut short. The responsibility to address this crisis can no longer be postponed. -- -- 1 CEO and Founder of Nudge Health Visit us atwww.mynudgehealth.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

Alcohol has been around forever and will be around for a long time. Some people are able to drink a glass occasionally for celebration and many people can not. Those are the people who I see as an addiction nurse. People who suffer from trauma, and pain, got into the notion of covering the pain by drinking alcohol to numb the painful memories. I had seen people become addicted to alcohol as a child as they were given regular drinks by parents, aunts, abusers, and more. A devastating cycle. I believe everyone deserves a chance to get out of addiction. I believe addiction is not a choice. People can easily get lost in the path down on the addiction road and can find it very difficult to get out. Many people drink socially feeling they need to do so to follow the societal norm.

      "Access to birth control is the touchstone of reproductive health and personal autonomy, yet it remains highly divisive across societies. Public control over access to birth control is the ability of every individual to obtain advanced contraception without cost, stigma, or the effect of restrictive laws. But the whole need has now come to the forefront for public debate again due to recent political and social developments. Family planning, education, and economic stability dot an individual‚Äôs pathway to health through birth control. Studies proved that contraception access significantly mitigates unintended pregnancies and improves maternal and child health outcomes. Millions yet face hurdles when accessing birth control, which is ironic considering merchandise that holds such great benefits. Economic inequality, inadequate health infrastructure, and barriers to sociopolitical factors are preventers of section marginalized communities from accessing contraceptive service. Public control here is calling for policies catering to equality that‚Äôs priority for accessibility. Governments should subsidize funding into such programs, promote comprehensive sex education, as well as fight against stigma at birth control. This also has to relate with legal protection towards preventing the rollback of reproductive rights, which is yet another issue fast growing across certain regions. The empowerment of all individuals regarding informed reproductive choices- not only health but also rights claim to be human rights. Accessible affordable birth control will usher everyone towards healthy, more independent living. -- -- Health and Medicine expert Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",
      "Why Parents Should Include Their Children In Organized Sports It‚Äôs important that parents put their kids in organized sports while growing up as it has many benefits such as maintaining strong health, heightened concentration in school, as well as psychological and social benefits as they progress into adulthood. I can vouch that sports have shaped the person I am today and helped me overcome the obstacles I encountered while growing up. When my parents separated and went through the divorce process, sports were a pivotal outlet for me. It was an area of freedom and fun away from my outside life. As a young adult who has suffered from anxiety and depression since I was thirteen due to the things happening with my family, I can say without a doubt that sports saved me. Many of my fondest memories and accomplishments came from being in sports, like scoring the game winning goal with thirty-one seconds left my junior year to be crowned the league champions with my soccer team. I don‚Äôt get the best moment of my life without organized sports. For starters, physical activity helps maintain strong health. Exercising is one of the best ways to keep children in shape and to help prevent diseases and illnesses. (National Institutes of Health, 2016). Studies showed that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of injuries, different types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer, as well as reducing risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure. The American Journal of Preventive Medicine said after school physical programs have reduced obesity the most. Having your kids stay active would help reduce lower medical care as they would be healthier more often which also results in less financial burdens. As mothers and fathers, one of your main goals in life is to always keep your kids safe, and having kids in organized sports keeps your kids healthy which helps towards that goal. Kids participating in organized sports growing up have shown to translate into benefits in the learning environment. A study that followed children from kindergarten to fourth grade showed that physical activities help children to develop and improve their cognitive skills. It has been associated with children getting better grades and doing better on standardized tests. Physical activity has also been shown to improve attitudes and academic behavior including ‚Äúenhanced concentration and attention‚Äù (GAO, 2012). Sports have always motivated me to have higher concentration in my academics to make sure I maintained solid grades. My parents would not allow me to participate in my sports if my grades weren‚Äôt good. That extra incentive while growing up helped me especially in middle school to stay focused and committed to getting good grades. Those good grades alongside sports helped me get admitted into a selective prep high school. Studies on the high school age group showed that teenagers who participated in sports are more likely to attend college and get degrees than non-athletes. Studies have shown that sports can have beneficial effects on individuals even into their adulthoods, which explained that the benefits extend into the workplace. A survey of 400 female corporate executives found that 94% played a sport growing up and 61% said it beneficially impacted their career success. (EY Women Athletes Business Network/espnW, 2014). Additionally, physical activity has also been proven to have a positive impact on mental health and social skills. Kids who are involved in physical activity have reported to have more excitement, more happiness and motivation in their day to day lives, whereas kids who are inactive reported greater nervousness, anxiety, depression, and worry. Physical activity has been shown to boost self-esteem, leadership, and goal-setting skills. A 2019 study found that children who reported to have no physical activity in their life were twice as likely to have mental health issues. According to the United Nations, sports have been proven to provide a safe environment and community for many participants. They may be having trouble at school or having issues at home. Organized sports have helped kids find an outlet from their everyday lives. It helps unite these kids to learn how to work together in a manner that also teaches them to learn the value of teamwork and respect. Additionally, it helps teach children at a young age to develop a passion for something. I fell in love with soccer and basketball when I was three. I developed many of the friendships and relationships I hold dear to this day. The community I fostered at a young age never faltered. I still reach out to old coaches I have had in the past for advice and guidance. I still keep in touch with old teammates and all of us wish each other success and happiness whenever we see one another accomplishing the goals we set when we were younger. I acknowledge that organized sports as the years progress the cost to participate also increases. There‚Äôs a fee for equipment, travel cost, hotel and food. My parents paid for me to play club soccer from age ten to eighteen. Countless practices and games. Many tournaments required us to travel to different states. Different jerseys, shorts, and socks each and every year. I agree that it can add up. When I spoke to my parents, I had asked them if they regretted any of it and they said no. They were just proud of where their daughter is today.

      "There‚Äôs a weight that settles deep within you, one that no amount of sleep seems to lift. You try to rest, to let go, but the moment you close your eyes, the thoughts come rushing in.Did I do enough today? Did I say the right thing? What about tomorrow?It‚Äôs like trying to swim in quicksand ‚Äî the harder you fight, the deeper you sink. Rest isn‚Äôt just lying down; it‚Äôs surrendering, and for some of us, surrender feels dangerous. The silence of stillness can be deafening, amplifying all the doubts and fears we‚Äôve spent the day trying to drown out. We tell ourselves we‚Äôll rest later, after we‚Äôve done more, fixed more, achieved more. But later never comes, and the exhaustion grows, until even the idea of rest feels impossible. Somewhere along the way, we learned to equate rest with laziness, with failure.If you stop, you‚Äôll fall behind.If you rest, you‚Äôre weak.These lies become our truth, and we wear our exhaustion like a badge of honor, proof that we‚Äôre working hard, trying hard, living hard. But deep down, we know the truth: we‚Äôre breaking. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôve convinced yourself that your worth is tied to how much you do, how much you give, how much you endure. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôre afraid of what might surface in the quiet ‚Äî the fears you‚Äôve buried, the grief you‚Äôve ignored, the parts of yourself you‚Äôve been too scared to face. Just like your heart needs a beat of silence between every pulse, you need moments to pause, to breathe, to simply exist without expectation. Rest isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness; it‚Äôs an act of courage. It‚Äôs saying,I choose to care for myself, even when the world tells me I shouldn‚Äôt. And yes, it‚Äôs terrifying. Slowing down feels like losing control. But control is an illusion anyway. The world will keep spinning whether you‚Äôre running yourself into the ground or taking a moment to recover. The difference is, when you choose rest, you give yourself a chance to heal, to rebuild, to carry on without breaking completely. So, if you feel like you can‚Äôt stop ‚Äî stop anyway. Not forever, not all at once, but for a moment. Let the world wait. Let the guilt scream and the doubts whisper. Sit with them. Breathe through them. And remind yourself of this truth:you are not your productivity. Your value isn‚Äôt measured by how much you give to others but by the fact that you are here, alive, trying. Even if rest feels impossible now, it‚Äôs not. Start small ‚Äî a breath, a pause, a moment of stillness. You deserve to be whole, not just what‚Äôs left after everyone else has taken their share. You deserve peace, even when the world doesn‚Äôt offer it freely. And most of all, you deserve rest ‚Äî because you‚Äôve carried enough for today. -- -- Navigating mental health, and something about growth.

      "Below is an unanswered, unacknowledged email I sent about my foodborne botulism case to a journalist in Indianapolis, Indiana . I almost died of food poisoning, was paralyzed and on a ventilator of two months, and it doesn‚Äôt make the paper? No news outlets? Not even a blogpost? Are you kidding me? I am just now healthy enough to write about it. I am not going to shut up about it, because food safety will only get worse under this next administration. Until I am dead, I will not be silenced. Hello Ms. Xxxxxx, I received your information from Xssss Xssssssss, a colleague of yours. He thought you would be the person to direct this story. On August 5th, 2024, my husband and I contracted foodborne botulism. After a night of violent vomiting and other gastrointestinal distress, things turned worse. Within hours, I lost the use of my legs and had shortness of breath. My husband was vomiting as well and had double vision and we were both slurring our words. Something deathly was wrong. We called my brother-in-law, a hospitalist MD out of Xxxxxxx, and he said to go to the emergency room immediately. My father-in-law from Xxxxxxx happened to be in the area visiting his sister and took my husband to Community North. We called an ambulance for me because I couldn‚Äôt move and was gasping for air. We believe we were diagnosed with botulism in a timely manner because we went in together. By all looks of things, my husband, a fifty-year-old, looked like he was having a stroke. What we conjecture is that his symptoms along with my descending paralysis from the head down was how they caught it. By then, the paralysis had reached my diaphragm and I could no longer breathe on my own. By the Grace of God and excellent medical care, a doctor recognized our combined symptoms as botulism. There is a test for botulism, and that takes four days. I think without intervention, I would have been dead within hours. The doctor called the CDC and an anti-toxin was flown in from Chicago. The anti-toxin was administered, and we lived. My husband left the hospital, walking with a cane breathing on his own, in three weeks. My exposure must have been more extreme because I was a lot sicker. After two days of struggling to breath, I was intubated after what can only be categorized as a near death experience. I later had a tracheostomy and breathed through a tube in my neck for eight weeks. It took me a full twelve weeks to recover from the paralysis to walk and talk again. It has been five months, and I still have to walk with a walker. That is one heck of a story, right? So why is our case on the CDC or Indiana Health Department‚Äôs website? I called the Indiana Health Department and they said there has to be at least ten cases in order for it to be worthy of public record. Two cases of botulism are two cases too many. I understand because of HIPPA, that my anonymity is paramount, but so is public health. I am willing to out myself to bring attention to this deadly, but treatable disease. Yes, botulism is rare and only deadly in five percent of cases, if it is caught in time. Many of my doctors and nurses said they haven‚Äôt seen a botulism case in twenty years. That doesn‚Äôt mean that there were unreported botulism because it was not diagnosed in time. Undiagnosed botulism looks like heart failure or unexplained pnemonia. I was lucky and healthy enough to recover. I was lucky to have insurance and to live in Indianapolis with access to top notch health centers like Community North and Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana (RHI). I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to have the forty pounds to lose in two months. I had no underlying conditions. You change one factor, and I‚Äôm dead of suffocation or heart failure in the first twenty-four hours, or I‚Äôm dead of pneumonia in two weeks. I am a miracle of luck and medical science, and no one outside of my inner circle knows about it. I want everyone to know about it. Our food supply chain is already shaky because of monopolies, and I fear with the incoming administration and the overturning of the Chevron decision that essentially weakened Federal agencies, such as the FDA, things will get worse. If my ordeal can make a difference, I am willing to forgo my anonymity for healthcare providers, legislators, and the public to know how to protect themselves when dinner turns deadly. I am looking forward to speaking with you. Sincerely, M*** K***** Botulism Survivor -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",
      "With around ‚Öì of the child population overweight or obese and 40% unable to read at a basic level, I think we can all agree that good health and academic optimization are two things America needs more of (Fiorenzi;Literacy Statistics 2022‚Äì2023). What if I were to tell you that there is a simple action that American schools can take that addresses both health complications and academic hardships? Well, I hope you‚Äôre on the edge of your seat because I want you to get out of it. That‚Äôs right‚Äì stand up, as my research has led me to believe that the solution is standing! American schools should transition to sit-to-stand desks to take advantage of the plethora of benefits to standing instead of sitting, ranging from hindering health issues like diabetes and ADHD to cultivating academic success by improving mood and averting hours of unproductivity. Tens of thousands of hours of every American‚Äôs life is spent at school, and 65‚Äì70% of this time is spent sitting down (Leech;Prepwise).Sitting is the new smoking, you might have heard, and this claim is backed by findings linking health complications such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease to sedentary time (Fiorenzi). Fortunately, standing desks, being on the path to movement, aids in combating each of such complications. Standing burns more calories than sitting, averaging an additional 50 calories per hour in adults, and studies have shown that obese or overweight children burn even more than their healthy-weight peers (Fiorenzi). Standing has been found to reduce blood sugar spikes after meals, a benefit especially helpful for diabetics but good for everyone since ‚Äúgreater amplitudes of glycemic variability have been linked to circulatory oxidative stress‚Äù (Jubbal). Standing is also connected with better heart health, as a study consisting of sitting and standing bus drivers observed that the standing drivers‚Äô risk for heart disease was half of that of the sitting drivers (Leech). If standing were to become the social norm, both the physiological perks and a new social pressure to be healthy enough to stand for longer periods would hinder health complications in the American school population. Consistent with the correlation between better health and academic achievement, sit-to-stand desks provide users with a better learning experience by optimizing key factors to academic success, including productivity, mood, and attention (Kurniawan;Schmidt;Valiente). One of the more obvious perks of a standing desk is postural improvement; good posture naturally reduces back, neck and sciatica pain (Leech). According to astudy, patients suffering from chronic pain had an average reduction of 9.8 hours of work productivity per week. I‚Äôm not sure about you, but I can learn quite a lot in almost 10 hours. A lesser known perk of a standing desk is its effect on mood: a positive one to be more specific. In one study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue and 87% reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day and after returning to sitting desks their moods reverted to their original levels (Leech). This study complements other research finding sitting and sedentary lifestyles linked with increased risks of depression and anxiety (Leech). As a student, I can attest that maintaining a positive outlook has pushed me to take risks that have led to my own academic success. Although you might have expected that standing desks would create distraction for children, I have found far more evidence suggesting just the opposite. I acknowledge that there is some anecdotal evidence documenting young children bumping into one another while using standing desks, however, recall that chairs create similar distractions including rocking, footsie, and leg swinging (‚ÄúThe Effects of Standing Desks‚Äù). On the other hand, one study demonstrated that students using standing desks exhibited ‚Äúsignificant improvements in attention and inhibitory control compared to their sitting peers,‚Äù and schoolchildren in the experiment group of another study that used standing-desks were found to be between 12 and 25% more engaged than the control group (Fiorenzi;Otto). Dr. Mark Benden of Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health explains this finding well: ‚ÄúWhen kids sit at a desk all day, they don‚Äôt have to use any energy, which means they can just as easily fall asleep, daydream, or distract themselves by distracting others‚Äù (Fiorenzi). At least for me, it ismuchharder to fall asleep standing up. Considering that standing expends more energy than sitting, it‚Äôs logical that distraction would be reduced, a boon particularly for millions of American children diagnosed with ADD or ADHD (Fiorenzi). Hopefully at this point, you‚Äôre convinced that standing desks have immense benefits. You may still be wondering, though, is it worth the effort to replace all sitting desks with standing desks? Allow me to clarify what I mean by ‚Äútransitioning to sit-to-stand desks.‚Äù It‚Äôd be a waste to toss out perfectly adequate sitting desks already owned, but I do think that when schools are in the market for new desks, they should purchase sit-to-stand desks. Sit-to-stand desks allow users to adjust the height of the desk, giving them the option to sit or stand, thereby taking into consideration the needs of physically disabled children and providing flexibility for various activities. Lastly, whereas the monetary price of sit-to-stand desks might be slightly more than that of a sitting-only desk, having the ability to make use of the numerous, substantial advantages of standing sure seem to outweigh that small cost differential. If you believe in having a healthy, educated population, I urge you to use your influence as a student, parent, teacher, staff member, administrator, or alumni to advocate for sit-to-stand desks in your school.

      "Modern medicine has made incredible strides in helping people live longer. But researchers aren‚Äôt just focused on adding years ‚Äî they‚Äôre looking to extend health alongside lifespan. A recent study offers a glimpse into what may be possible: combining two FDA-approved drugs,trametinibandrapamycin, resulted in a significant lifespan increase in mice, while also improving their health in old age. Researchers gave one group of mice trametinib, another group rapamycin, and a third group a combination of the two. The results were striking: ‚Ä¢Trametinib aloneextended median lifespan by7%‚Äì10%, depending on sex. ‚Ä¢Rapamycin aloneincreased lifespan by17%‚Äì18%. ‚Ä¢ Thecombination of both drugsshowed the most dramatic effects, boosting lifespan by35% in femalesand27% in males. What‚Äôs more, the maximum lifespan (the longest any mice lived) increased significantly when both drugs were used together, highlighting their additive benefits. Both drugs target different cellular pathways involved in aging: ‚Ä¢Trametinibworks on a pathway that regulates cell growth. ‚Ä¢Rapamycininhibits a pathway linked to inflammation and age-related diseases. By combining these mechanisms, the drugs created a stronger anti-aging effect than either could achieve alone. Extending lifespan is one thing, but how did the micefeelas they aged? Researchers found the drug combo also improved key markers of health: ‚Ä¢Heart health:Delayed age-related decline in heart function. ‚Ä¢Tumors:Reduced tumor growth and overall tumor load. ‚Ä¢Inflammation:Lowered inflammation in the brain and body. However, it wasn‚Äôt all good news. Some mice experienced side effects like fatty liver disease and testicular degeneration, raising questions about how these drugs might work in humans. Both trametinib and rapamycin are FDA-approved, but for very different uses: ‚Ä¢Trametinibtreats certain types of cancer. ‚Ä¢Rapamycinis used after organ transplants to prevent rejection. The fact that these drugs are already approved opens the door for further research into their potential as longevity treatments. However, what works in mice doesn‚Äôt always translate to humans. Animal studies like this are an exciting starting point, but testing in humans could take decades. Scientists are now exploring whether combining even more drugs ‚Äî like diabetes medications metformin and acarbose ‚Äî could create an even stronger anti-aging effect. The goal is to target multiple cellular pathways to not only extend lifespan but also reduce age-related diseases. But before you get too excited, remember: it‚Äôs still early days. While these findings are promising, the path from lab to human trials is long and full of challenges. This study highlights the potential of drug combinations to unlock new frontiers in longevity research. While human applications are still far off, these findings show that targeting multiple aging pathways could be the key to living not just longer, but healthier lives.

      "A few months ago, I found myself feeling completely out of sync. Life in Washington, D.C. had become overwhelming ‚Äî constant noise, traffic, and endless distractions pulled me away from what truly mattered. I grew up in the countryside, where life was simpler and quieter. That connection to nature, that sense of peace ‚Äî it was missing. So, I made a bold decision: I packed my bags, left the city behind, and embraced what‚Äôs known asMonk Mode. For three months, I lived with monk-like discipline, stripped away distractions, and focused entirely on my personal and professional goals. One of those goals was particularly ambitious: running1,000 miles in a year. When I started Monk Mode, I‚Äôd only scratched the surface. But by the time I was done, I‚Äôd run500 miles in just three months, putting me firmly on track to crush my goal. That‚Äôs the power of Monk Mode. Monk Mode is a period of intentional focus, inspired by the simplicity and discipline of monks. It‚Äôs about cutting out distractions, clarifying your objectives, and dedicating yourself entirely to growth ‚Äî both personally and professionally.

Oranges. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like eating this fruit, but when I eat oranges, my hands will feel sticky and sometimes the aroma will linger on my hands for a long time. Every time I was offered oranges, I always argued, later. Later I will eat them, later I will finish them.Later, I said. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt know that citrus fruits can boost the immune system, avoiding colds. But it turns out that citrus fruits have more benefits than that, such as can improve digestion because it contains fiber, can prevent many diseases such as cancer, heart, kidney and even reduce the frequency of asthma attacks because it is anti-inflammatory. OK! Reading those benefits all sound very good. But how long can I eat this much citrus fruit. Unlike the needs of children under 15 years old who only need 50‚Äì65 mg per day. An adult like me needs 75‚Äì90mg of vitamin C intake per day in a fit condition. And one medium-sized orange contains approximately 70mg of vitamin C. Well, that‚Äôs enough for me. One orange a day. The more I search, the more I read. In fact, this fruit can easily be found all over the world. But what if I can‚Äôt find this fruit in some season. The research continues lead me to alternatives. I was suprised to find a guava fruit that has more than 126mg, rich in antioxidants and equal in one fruit. Wow. Apart from guava, papaya and strawberries can be other options that both contain antioxidants that help maintain brain health and flavonoids that are believed to prevent cancer and heart disease. Mangoes are also high in vitamin C, while guavas also contain vitamin A, which has been shown to boost the immune system and eye health. At the end of the research, I was glad. It‚Äôs okay for my hands to be sticky and orange-scented for a long time when I can benefit more from the fruit called oranges. A dislike led me to research and changed my thinking.

      "Picture this, you‚Äôre scrolling through Instagram and you see a fit man on his porch in Bali, waving his finger at the screen and telling you about a miracle detox tea. He claims that rigorous studies have proved it to increase weight loss by 200%‚Ä¶ Incredible, right? And how helpful of him to include an Amazon affiliate link where you can buy the tea‚Ä¶ Well, since Meta recently announced that they‚Äôll be removing fact-checking from its platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Threads), you‚Äôre left with the question of how you‚Äôll determine if the miracle tea is a hoax with fabricated statistics or a genuine scientific discovery. In Meta‚Äôs press video, CEO Mark Zuckerberg justifies the decision by saying that fact-checkers were too politically biased, and were making too many false positives ‚Äî taking down posts that didn‚Äôt spread erroneous facts. Additionally, he believes this is a step toward supporting free speech, supposedly a Meta and American value. Whether we resonate with Meta‚Äôs decision or not, those of us who work in healthcare, or merely care about our health, are left wondering where we‚Äôll get our health information from. According to a survey by the National Library of Medicine, 85% of people seek health information using social media, including WhatsApp, YouTube, and Facebook. Although the survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia, it can likely be generalized to most places, since we‚Äôre increasingly chronically online globally. This means we have to be extra cautious about the health information we share and consume online. Without the help of fact-checkers, how can you separate fact from fiction? If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Health improvements take time, consistency, and evidence-based methods. 2. Question the Source Look for advice from credible voices like licensed nutritionists, scientists, or reputable organizations ‚Äî not just influencers with slick branding. AtNutrix AI, we‚Äôre building a platform with evidence-based and easy-to-understand nutrition advice. 3. Ask the Why Behind the Claim When presented with a bold claim, ask: ‚ÄúWhy does this work?‚Äù If the person can‚Äôt explain beyond surface-level buzzwords, treat it as a red flag. For every answer they give, follow up with another ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù 4. Think Twice Before You Share What‚Äôs more dangerous than following ill-advised health advice? Sharing it with all of your friends and followers and putting them in danger too. Pause for a moment before sharing that Instagram reel or sending that message in a WhatsApp group, and ask yourself ‚ÄúHow safe and robust is this claim?‚Äù We live in an era where information is more accessible than ever, empowering billions to make informed decisions about their health. But with this abundance comes the challenge of distinguishing valuable insights from dangerous misinformation. Meta‚Äôs decision to remove fact-checkers doesn‚Äôt have to leave us adrift. Instead, it‚Äôs a call to action: to approach health advice with a critical eye, to rely on trusted sources, and to be mindful of the impact our shares have on others. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

During winter, I didn‚Äôt feel thirsty and thought coffee was enough to keep me hydrated. The warm comfort of a steaming cup seemed perfect for the season. However, I overlooked the fact that coffee is a diuretic, which means it causes the body to lose water. This routine continued for about ten days, and my body began showing signs of dehydration.

      "That is what the urologist told me as I lay on the operating table, wondering how it had come to this. Then almost as an afterthought, she added:‚Äú‚Ä¶that is, if you get to keep them both.‚Äù Before you jump to any conclusions,I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.I didn‚Äôt take a hit to the groin, try a weird yoga pose, or do anything unusual in the bedroom. It was a normal sunny morning, full of possibilities until it was obliterated by a sudden pain in my left testicle. At first, it was just a twinge, but every time I moved, it got worse. Still, it wasn‚Äôt agony. Definitely not‚Äúrush to the hospital‚Äùterritory. Besides, I had plans. It was a big New Year‚Äôs Eve bash and nothing was going to ruin that. Except, of course, my balls. In the end, the pain became impossible to ignore, and I had to tell my friends I couldn‚Äôt make it out. Luckily, they were supportive and one of them sent me a medical helpline number and told me to call. Naturally, like anyone in need of an expert‚Äôs opinion, I turned to Google. Testicular torsion ‚Äî a condition where the spermatic cord twists, cutting off blood flow to the testicle ‚Äî kept appearing with urgent warnings to act within six hours. But I‚Äôd been in pain all day so I was‚Äútechnically‚Äùsafe. But that wasn‚Äôt the real reason I didn‚Äôt call right away‚Ä¶ The truth is, I have small, some might say (not me) ladylike hands. And I couldn‚Äôt stop picturing dropping my pants and having my dynamic duo manhandled by some ogre of a man‚Äôs giant hands, like a gorilla fumbling with cherries. So, I made the crucial mistake of sleeping on it.‚ÄúIf it still hurts in the morning,‚ÄùI decided,‚Äúthen I‚Äôll call the number.‚Äù So, after a night of very little sleep and multiple testicle-related nightmares, I dialed the helpline. The medical questions came fast, and I was nailing them.‚ÄúNo,‚ÄùI said confidently (and truthfully) to everything: swelling?No.Fever?Nope.The wrong colour?God, no. I was breezing through their questions, and by the time they‚Äôd finished, I felt like I‚Äôd just aced a maths test. ‚ÄúAre you alone?‚Äùthe lady asked, breaking my self-congratulatory haze.‚ÄúI‚Äôm with my parents,‚ÄùI replied.‚ÄúGood, because you need to get to the hospital immediately!‚ÄùMy stomach sank as she delivered the bombshell diagnosis:‚ÄúIt might be testicular torsion.‚Äù As I sat in the car, panic rising in my chest, I couldn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd let something as stupid as my fear of big hands keep me from getting help sooner. Would I really rather lose a ball than let a big-handed man touch me? Apparently, yes. And now I wondered if my hesitation had cost me everything. At the hospital, I found some small comfort in the fact that, so far, only women had been tasked with examining my precious cargo. First, a kind nurse asked a few questions, then a calm technician performed an ultrasound ‚Äî no sign of any gorilla-handed ogre-men. But then the results came back.‚ÄúYou need to get to another hospital,‚Äùthey said.‚ÄúNow.‚Äù Suddenly, I was in an ambulance, sirens blaring, racing toward a urologist who would decide the fate of my crown jewels. That‚Äôs when it hit me: this wasn‚Äôt a joke, and my balls weren‚Äôt going to wait for me to grow up and act like a man. At the next hospital, I met the urologist who explained everything to me in a calm, clinical tone ‚Äî like she could have been talking about fixing a leaky tap instead of performing surgery on one of the most fragile parts of my body. She described how they‚Äôd carve an incision down the centre and take a look inside for signs of necrosis. If it was alive and pink, they‚Äôd untwist it and tie it to the scrotum to prevent future torsions; if it was dead and black, they‚Äôd remove it. ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs in-between?‚ÄùI blurted, as I tried to haggle over my gonads like it was some sort of hostage situation.‚ÄúLike, not dead, but not exactly thriving?‚Äù She stared at me, unimpressed.‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs alive, we keep it. If it‚Äôs dead, we don‚Äôt.‚Äù For a split second, I thought about suggesting,‚ÄúWhat if we just let it heal? Maybe give it some vitamins?‚ÄùBut deep down, I knew I‚Äôd already had my chance to save it. Hanging on to a bad ball could mean losing both, and no amount of wishful thinking could change that, even if it was my favourite one. After one last round of negotiating, where I attempted to micromanage how they‚Äôd tie my man eggs to the sac, they gave me an oxygen mask and the sweet release of unconsciousness. I woke up groggy and in pain with one clear thought:Ouch, my balls. Wait ‚Äî myballs? I‚Äôd never felt happier to say that sentence to myself. The next day, as I was getting ready to leave the hospital, relieved to still have both my boy berries, a male nurse gave me one final check. His hands were massive. And yes, he manhandled my balls. It hurt. A lot. But as he squeezed and twisted my poor orbs, making sure the stitches were good, I realised something important: I‚Äôd rather be manhandled and alive than too scared to act and lose it all. I was one of the rare, extremely lucky cases. Despite delaying my trip to the hospital, I walked away with both testes intact. But not everyone is so lucky. Since my surgery, I‚Äôve spent time onforums exchanging recovery tipswith other people who‚Äôve been through this, and it‚Äôs shocking how many of them ended up losing a ball. One story stuck with me ‚Äî a 14-year-old boy who posted online that he‚Äôd been in excruciating pain for three days and couldn‚Äôt stop throwing up, asking,‚ÄúHow do I tell my parents?‚ÄùBy the time he finally sought out help, it was too late. He was lucky to keep one. It‚Äôs stories like this that remind me how close I came to losing mine and how shame has no place when your health is on the line. Whatever fear or embarrassment is keeping you from seeing a doctor, it‚Äôs not worth the risk. Trust me, if something feels off, don‚Äôt wait. Your balls deserve to be seen, touched, and manhandled.

      "Some days make you feel like you should buy a lottery ticket, thanks to coincidences that leave you asking, ‚ÄúWhat are the odds?‚Äù Today was one of those days. I had my blood drawn for an annual study I‚Äôve been participating in since 2017. The study aims to determine if specific markers can help detect ovarian cancer earlier in its progression. Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in women and the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers, according to theAmerican Cancer Society. About half of the women with ovarian cancer are 63 or older. Unlike other gynecologic cancers, such as cervical cancer and breast cancer, which have routine screenings like Pap smears and mammograms, ovarian cancer often isn‚Äôt detected until it has advanced, usually by stage III or IV. And it can only be confirmed through a tissue biopsy. Although it‚Äôs a rare cancer, its aggressive nature makes early detection critical.

      "One evening, it showered outside. My mom grabbed a vessel to collect the rainwater. She ran to the terrace and placed it on the beam. The rain stopped within a few minutes. I eagerly went to take the vessel but ended in dismay. I thought half of the pot would have been filled. Only 5% of the pot has been filled. Anyhow, I couldn‚Äôt wait to taste it. I wondered why we hadn‚Äôt considered tasting the rainwater all these years. I thought drinking rainwater would catch cold for me. I also believed that it would be tasteless or neutral. With all curiosity, I had a sip. Wow‚Ä¶ It was as sweet as the filtered water that we drank every day. It isn‚Äôt similar to that but possesses a unique taste. No water in the world tastes similar to rainwater. We install water purifiers at home to bring that taste. But, God has made it naturally without any water purifiers. His blessing has been instilled in the rainwater. I could drink only a very little as I had to share with my mom and aunt too. My aunt said that one of our neighbours cooks food only with rainwater. My curiosity spikes high to give it a try. -- -- 4 ‚ÄúReaders Club‚Äù is a reader-centered publication that delivers valuable insights across diverse topics.

      "How to quit addictions, diet, etc. Self-discipline is the primary skills that help you avoid acting against your best interests. Self-discipline can help you avoid overeating, overspending, smoking, unwanted body language, nail-biting, procrastination, laziness, and experiencing unwanted emotional responses like fear, negativity, or anger. All of these share commonalities and have overlapping solutions. If you‚Äôve successfully addressed one self-sabotaging behavior, you can likely adapt your approach to tackle others. Mindset is crucial in all cases. Step 1: Accepting that there is a problem. Step 2: Identify reasons for change.Change is much easier if backed by good reasons. Obviously, most people find it much easier to change their diet after a heart attack. If your reasons for change seem weak, it may mean that other improvements are more pressing. This is great to know, as it can alleviate guilt or stress. However, it may also mean that you are lying to yourself about how significant the reasons are or that you should research or consider better reasons. Step 3:Ask yourself why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Understanding why you engage in certain behaviors can help you mitigate or leverage your psychological quirks. For example, if you consistently eat every chocolate bar in a multipack, changing your shopping habits might be a solution. Recognizing when you deceive yourself is crucial. Experiment until you find an approach that works for you. Determining why you act against your interests can be as simple as noting reasons when you act against your goals or consciously thinking about why you don‚Äôt behave as you‚Äôd like. Many bad habits stem from insecurities or negative beliefs. Where this is the case, you‚Äôll often need to improve your mindset. One of the best ways to do this is to disprove them. Do this by finding someone who has overcome similar obstacles in equally or even more challenging circumstances. Witnessing others‚Äô success can debunk limiting beliefs and motivate you. Also, finding out what they did can help. The most common reason for self-sabotaging behavior is disregarding the long term to the extent that it becomes destructive. It can be challenging to make yourself care about something that is far off. Visualizing your reasons can make long-term concepts seem less abstract. Another tip is to measure; checking your health, for example, will indicate if you are on the right path. Step 4: Rules.Establishing rules to handle situations where you typically act against your best interests makes you less likely to falter. For example, let‚Äôs assume you‚Äôre tackling overspending. You‚Äôve made a prioritized list of things to buy and have a rule to stick to these priorities. However, you notice that when shopping, you often see something that isn‚Äôt yet on your list and immediately buy it. A new rule that unless a purchase is essential, you can‚Äôt buy anything you‚Äôve added to your list for a full day should remind you before each time this occurs. If you use rules, you should review them whenever you break one, mainly to identify consistent trends. Reviews create a mild annoyance, which can serve as a good disincentive. Punishing yourself more than this is counterproductive; many people berate themselves to the extent that they become depressed. Worse, in many cases, people have conditioned themselves to engage in the behavior they aim to avoid. They may turn to unhealthy eating, substance abuse, smoking, etc., when feeling depressed, perpetuating a destructive cycle. Forgive yourself quickly if you break a rule, but understand that this does not permit you to break that rule again. If you commonly break the same rule in the same way, more drastic action may be necessary. This may involve avoiding the triggering situation entirely. Alternatively, adjust other aspects of your plan to compensate for this. You could address the issue in smaller steps or strive to resist the compulsion incrementally. Importantly, repeatedly breaking the same rule in the same way is a sign that you may need external help. Avoid adding too many rules at once; introducing rules gradually helps make them manageable and memorable. When all the rules are in place, they should address the specific issue; be wary of too many exceptions. We recommend monthly reviews of unwanted behaviors you aim to change until you are confident they are solved for good. During reviews, assess your adherence to the rules, their effectiveness, and any needed adjustments. Keeping your rules in place long after a behavioral change helps reinforce your progress and catch potential lapses early. Ideally, schedule recurring reminders in a calendar app (like Google Calendar). Eventually, you can remove these reminders, perhaps after a year since your last significant change or lapse. Step 5: Understand the issue you are addressing. Most people can outline an adequate diet; the tricky part is having the mental strength to sustain it. Your solution may be more difficult or punitive than necessary or have other health implications. We‚Äôre not suggesting that you shouldn‚Äôt educate yourself about dieting; it‚Äôs just that the mental side matters more. Some issues only manifest when you are in a poor mental state, such as becoming dangerous when angry or intoxicated. For such problems, practice is limited, and one slip-up can potentially have catastrophic consequences. One way to mitigate problems that seldom occur is to think about and, ideally, visualize the situation and its solution. Reasoning, when you are rational, before entering a fraught state, can help. Visualizing and setting rules can also be effective for other issues, but they are especially crucial if you have minimal chances to practice. Still, visualization will not make solving these problems easy. If you‚Äôve experienced issues before, for instance, it‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that you can maintain discipline while drunk. The best approach may be to avoid ever getting intoxicated. Similarly, for some, avoiding anger altogether may be easier than controlling it once it arises. Addressing inadvertent body language, like dieting, requires constant vigilance. Suppose your body language communicates boredom. It is hard to focus mainly on your body language while also on the conversation. Focus can be extremely draining, especially over extended periods, such as full days of meetings. Merely avoiding boring people or meetings provides only a partial solution. A better approach may be to increase your engagement so that you no longer feel bored, perhaps via a challenge. In anticipation of a potentially dull conversation, you could work on personal development, such as improving your storytelling skills, finding polite ways to end conversations, or becoming a better listener. Further tips Concurrently addressing several self-sabotaging behaviors is generally unwise. Willpower is finite and depletes throughout the day, replenishing during sleep. Making many decisions or lacking sleep can make it much harder to implement willpower-related changes. For further insights on this topic and strategies to overcome similar problems, consider reading Kelly McGonigal‚Äôs excellent book,The Willpower Instinct. Robyn Youkilis‚ÄôsThin From Withinis another valuable resource, especially if dieting is your focus. Thanks for reading.

      "Welcome to the future, my friend! You know how we‚Äôve all been talking about robots, self-driving cars, and the AI takeover? Well, 2025 has officially arrived, and AI isn‚Äôt just a buzzword anymore ‚Äî it‚Äôs running the show. We‚Äôre not talking about simple tasks anymore; AI is getting morepersonal, morecreative, and even a littleemotional(yes, AI has feelings now, sort of). So buckle up, because this post is about to dive into the quirkiest, most game-changing AI trends of 2025. Let‚Äôs break it down and have some fun while we‚Äôre at it. Okay, picture this: you‚Äôre having a rough day, and your phone ‚Äî without any drama ‚Äî sends you a text that says, ‚ÄúHey, I got your back.‚Äù No, it‚Äôs not your BFF; it‚Äôs Emotional AI.

      "ON JANUARY 21, 2025 BY PHOTOMOTOMAN IN POLITICAL EDITORIAL Share This! I am a retired Fire Chief, and former educator. For the last 30 years of my 43 year career in the fire service, I attempted to make people aware as to how climate change was affecting our lives. It started with discussions in relation to my roles at the time, as a college instructor, and professionally as a fire service instructor. That was 32 years ago. It became more and more obvious, that in relation to global warming, the burning of fossil fuels was the cause, not simply implicated, but directly causative. And throughout all of this time, the fossil fuel industry, its spokesmen, CEO‚Äôs, CAO‚Äôs, CFO‚Äôs, their boards and their employees, all knew the facts. All ignored the facts, and all lied about the facts. For me, my experience first began in earnest in 1989, when fires ravaged northern Manitoba, my province. I was contracted to the Provincial Government, teaching firefighting and wild land firefighting to native firefighters in the north. In my time off from being a full-time firefighter, I trained as SARTEC, dive rescue instructor and mountain rescue instructor, which I acquired privately by training outside the country. I also travelled throughout the North under contract. That year, fires forced the evacuation of 25,000 people across 25 communities. However in 2003, I resigned from my fire department in order to take a Fire Chief‚Äôs position in another Province. I had gone through all the interviews, been selected for the position, but hiring was stalled due to fires surrounding the city in British Columbia where I had been, technically hired. That year, the provinces budget for fighting forest and wild land fire was 54 million dollars. By the end of the summer, the Province of British Columbia had spent 554 million dollars fighting those fires. In the interim, unable to wait for the city to hire as I had already resigned my position, I took a position as the Fire Chief for a newly amalgamated fire service in Ontario, Canada in the Region of Niagara. After eight years, I found myself successfully hired as the Fire Chief for a jurisdiction in Alberta, Canada, that surrounded Calgary, Alberta. Within this jurisdiction was a scenic town, adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and Kananaskis Provincial Park. The fire risk, within what is known as the wild land interface fire zone, was, and remains, extreme. My attempts to convince the administration, the council, and the citizens of the jurisdiction that they faced enormous risk, where fire on the landscape between the mountains and the town had not seen fire for 150 years, and where the forest and its deadfall had never been reduced or culled during that period, fell on deaf ears. It is also notable that this jurisdiction is an oil production area that saw over 9,000 wells drilled in 2010. I often wondered how much pressure behind the scenes the fossil fuels industry exerted or had influence over that administration in relation to the decisions that those councillors reached? I will never know, but based on what is occurring in Canada today it is obvious that all the other jurisdictions that produce or are dependent on the fossil fuels industry fully intend to ignore climate change and the impact that the extraction of oil and gas has on it. They divorce themselves from the reality that extraction is exactly the same as burning the product, which it ultimately accomplishes. As my contract ended, and I began a job consulting, in May 2011, a forest fire surrounding Slave Lake, Alberta, home to 7000 people, saw one-third of the town destroyed by a wild land interface fire. The loss amounted to 700 million dollars. Five years later, in May 2016, Fort McMurray experienced the same result, resulting in the loss of 2,400 structures. The loss amounted to 3.7 billion dollars, just in insured losses. A 2017 study from MacEwan University estimated total losses were in the range of $9 billion dollars. In 2023, Canada‚Äôs most destructive year to date, there were more than 6,000 fires, and 29 mega fires, that burned 41 million acres, ten times what was previously considered a bad year in Canada. Experts in the climate sciences have proven unequivocally that the cause of these fires is due to global warming, insect infestations cause by global warming and the burning of fossil fuels. And then this year, Jasper, Alberta, one of the jewels of Canada‚Äôs National Parks saw a fire burn 1,113 structures. None of these occurrences is normal. None of this massive change in wild land and forestry fires is due to any natural processes. They are all attributable to anthropogenic climate change and the burning of fossil fuels. In 2023, in Lytton, BC, another Canadian town was destroyed by a fast moving wildfire. The temperatures for the last three years having exceeded 41 C. At some point, reached a temperature hitherto unknown in Canada in 2021 of 49.2 C or 121 F. This is a mountainous area surrounded by forested areas that are considered boreal rainforest. What Does All This Have To Do With Los Angeles? This week Audie Cornish of CNN did a podcast. Her guest was Peter Kalmus, a climate scientist for NASA. His former home, which was destroyed in the Los Angeles community of Altadena, was one of the more than 12,000 homes destroyed in the recent, and as yet, still burning fires. Peter, now self-described as a climate activist, grieves over the loss of his former community and recently wrote, ‚ÄúAs a Climate Scientist, I knew it was time to leave Los Angeles,‚Äù on January 10th, in the New York Times. His personal risk analysis had been ongoing for the entire 14 years he had lived in Altadena, and two years ago he moved his family to Durham, North Carolina. He did so, because he was convinced that the ever increasing temperatures in Southern California and Nevada would make the risk of living there, irrational. And this last week, he was proved right. What is happening is not simply anomalous, it is directly caused by global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels. Yet, Americans, unwilling to change, do not listen to climate scientists, they listen to shills for the fossil fuels industry on Fox and to the incoming President of the United States, a man who hasn‚Äôt told the truth about virtually anything for his entire time in office. The problem according to Kalmus, is that while the facts illustrate that things will only get worse, and quickly, the fossil fuels industry and those becoming rich from its extraction are doing everything possible to ensure that misinformation, disinformation and outright lies remain the mainstream news. Less than half of America elected the current President of the United States (49.9%), yet this ‚Äòmandate‚Äô enables a man without any scientific understanding, a man who denigrates and lies about the impacts of climate change, to influence a public whose own ignorance is so profound that they have swallowed and internalized all the lies. They are immune to intelligent discourse, of scientific facts and of the profound risks that the continued burning of fossil fuels poses for life on this little blue orb. So, Where is Safe? One of Kalmus‚Äô beliefs is that like lightning strikes, the impacts of drought, wild fires, massive rain events, hurricanes and their attendant tornadoes and storm surge are not easily predicted. Not only is the complexity of the problem itself astronomical, but the solutions, without acceptance of the fact that we not only need to stop in the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, but needed to, 50 years ago, is daunting. Much of what is to come, is baked into our future. Of that, there is certainty. And whether or not the earth has reached a tipping point will without question be known within the next twenty-five years. Meanwhile, the question remains. Where is safe? Kalmus states that in reality, nowhere is safe. Climate change is global. Obviously, those places that are within the wild land interface are less safe, as are the coasts of the United States and Canada that will face the brunt of hurricanes and ocean storm surge. But Ashland, North Carolina was considered extremely safe just a few years ago. So was Lytton, British Columbia. We are on a bobsled run into climate change that will be profound. It will reshape our lives and our relative safety and health. And because of our ignorance, because of our willingness to listen to liars and those invested in and profiting from the fossil fuel industry, we are facing what are planetary existential risks. And none of us, will escape its effects. -- -- My name is Ken McMullen. I‚Äôm a retired Director of Emergency Services and former academic.

      "Life is really tough for women, especially those in middle age. Eileen Chang once said that middle-aged men often feel lonely. When they open their eyes, everyone around them depends on them, but there‚Äôs no one they can depend on. Actually, middle-aged women feel helpless and have breakdowns more often than men do. Men deal with stress by going out for drinks with friends, acting a bit crazy, spending an afternoon smoking, playing a hard game of basketball, or throwing themselves into their work and forgetting about everything else. But that‚Äôs not how it is for women. They carry so much more on their shoulders. They can pick up the weight, but they can‚Äôt put it down. It‚Äôs not just about money. It‚Äôs also about their kids, their families, their age, and the problems they face at work. When all of these things come crashing down at once, a woman will still stand strong, even though she feels totally helpless. Middle-aged women may seem tough, but they still have weaknesses. And often, a midlife meltdown starts with these three things. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",
      "Even though I am happy in my current relationship, I find that I have some unresolved regrets and baggage from past relationships that are still affecting me.

      "The Heart That Matters By Terri Rimmer Shortly after moving into her little one-bedroom apartment Melody‚Äôs neighbor Samantha told her about a great restaurant within walking distance where you just pay what you can. Fantastic! She thought. The establishment was a media darling, had won some awards, and was the talk of the town, having been written up in various newspapers touting them as having such a giving heart to the homeless who could not afford to eat and others down on their luck. ‚ÄúYou can just give them $5, and they‚Äôll accept that, if you have it,‚Äù Samantha, who used a wheelchair, told Melody. In a few days they went to lunch there with Samantha‚Äôs granddaughter and Melody was pleasantly surprised at the service, friendliness, and quality of the food as well as the atmosphere. She would be back definitely. Over the course of a year she went back three more times, sometimes able to pay ‚Äî or not. She found out though that they did not want her five dollars. They wanted more and made that clear. Two years prior, Melody had been working full time but totaled her car during a panic attack at the wheel and couldn‚Äôt afford to get another vehicle. Because she was a pet and house sitter for a company this accident resulted in her losing her job, which snowballed into a life being upended. She was out of work for eight months, landed another position but was laid off within two months. A friend got her another job but due to her cognitive impairment Melody couldn‚Äôt do the work. Now she‚Äôd been out of a job for four years, the longest she‚Äôd ever been unemployed. Melody tried to volunteer at the restaurant, but some positions required her to stand on her feet for hours which she couldn‚Äôt do because of arthritis in her feet, knees, and back. The other job involved folding napkins in a specific way to include the silverware, but Melody‚Äôs injured shoulders kept her from performing that task. The third time Melody visited the restaurant she forgot to make a reservation, something Samantha had cautioned her against because the wait time would be an hour otherwise. She found herself sitting in an uncomfortable row of homeless people which she didn‚Äôt mind, except for this group‚Äôs attitude of entitlement. Melody searched for hours all day for a job but to no avail. She was overqualified, which to her was worse than being underqualified because you could always get the experience. But a professional writer/former pet and house sitter also with 40 years of clerical experience did not get hired flipping burgers or in retail although she had worked in those areas. Melody was seated the third and fourth time she visited the restaurant with the long table where homeless people sat and she noticed this group left lots of food on their plates and hardly touched it while talking on their phones about schemes and scams. And some would ask her for money which she found laughable. The owner approached her about the fact that she was not able to pay for her meal which didn‚Äôt include any extras, something she could have taken advantage of if she were that kind of person. He gave her a hard time and she left there feeling so ashamed. This was not the person she was. Now it was Christmas time and, after leaving her new allergist for a cough she‚Äôd had over a year that she‚Äôd been on over 19 medications for, she decided to take a chance on the restaurant again, this time having five dollars to pay. The allergist had given her the answer she‚Äôd been seeking since last year regarding her condition ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt contagious, it wasn‚Äôt her asthma, but her reflux that was causing the cough. Whew! She was so happy as she entered the restaurant, eyeing the tall, gorgeous tree inside though coughing, always wearing her mask. Others were openly coughing, too, but with no masks, something that always annoyed Melody. The manager took her name, and she didn‚Äôt have to wait long for a table, much to her surprise and she and her injured leg and rollator made their way to a table. She couldn‚Äôt stop coughing and kept her mask on as her routine. No sooner had she sat down than the manager came over. ‚ÄúHi, friend,‚Äù he said insincerely. ‚ÄúYou seem like you don‚Äôt feel well.‚Äù Melody explained the situation, but it was clear he didn‚Äôt believe her. ‚ÄúWell, if you can‚Äôt get that coughing under control you can‚Äôt eat today,‚Äù he told her which scared her to death because she had no food and she was diabetic. She thought about the last time she was there and how she helped a fellow patron who the manager was going to kick out for bringing a plastic bag into the restaurant. The woman lived in a group home and people stole things from her, so she brought some items with her. The manager had told the lady she would have to put everything in her tiny purse or would not be able to eat there that day. So, once he walked away Melody offered to put the stuff in her purse and when they were done eating, she would give it back to her outside the restaurant where the manager wouldn‚Äôt see it. ‚ÄúI know how it is,‚Äù Melody told the woman. ‚ÄúI was in a group home before.‚Äù So, they were able to enjoy a meal together as strangers but not so much. Now Melody ate her lunch as carefully as she could and managed not to cough during it but she felt so rejected and ashamed, less than, not like anyone should ever feel. As she grabbed her umbrella to leave the manager bid her farewell and she walked to the corner to meet her public transportation. ‚ÄúHonestly, it doesn‚Äôt get any better than the mission here!‚Äù spouted a customer. -- -- I have 41 years of journalism experience having written for ten newspapers, some magazines, and web sites.

But now, in addition to fucking up my hip, I also have pretty constant pain my knees. Since those things are all pretty important, I took myself to physical therapy (with no help from my crap health insurance). I know PT is something I need to do because I need to make sure I‚Äôm not doing anything that will cause permanent problems. However I would MUCH rather be spending that money on furniture for my new apartment. Ugh. Or RUNNING SHOES. But I‚Äôm making the executive decision to buy those tomorrow. Anyway, I now have a PT plan to help with the pain. And even though Iknowit will help me feel better, I will certainly not be excited about doing it. I‚Äôm also an instant gratification human, which is another reason that long-term projects are hard for me. I find myself rushing through writing and rushing through art projects just because I want them to bedone.I try to take shortcuts.

      "Are you also a perfectionist like me? I always wanted to score best marks in academics, either win or not to take part in competitions. Under too much pressure to be perfect, I was always an average student because instead of working hard, I kept brooding over the results and it has ceased me from participating in really good competitions. This all-or-nothing mentality also stopped me from writing for all these years as anything less than that was unacceptable to me. üòî I knew I had to make a change. It wasn‚Äôt an easy process, but I actively decided to find the solution. So, began to delve into several articles about perfectionism so that I can decide when to stop chasing for it. Learning deeply about perfectionism is the only way to deal with it as we cannot ignore the positive outcome we get by pursuing perfection. In this article, we will try to focus on taking the good part and ignore the bad things about flawlessness because without the desire to be the best, one cannot achieve his/her full potential. It‚Äôs the obsession that creates the problem. We just have to know the limits! Do you also have this weird tendency to chase perfection, even though deep down, you know it‚Äôs probably unattainable? Why do we do this? Let‚Äôs unpack that a bit. Essentially, striving for perfection originates from a positive desire to improve ourselves, our work, and the world around us. It encourages us to achieve great things and produce high-quality results. From an early age, we have been deluged with the images of apparently ‚Äòperfect lives' on social media, in movies and even in advertising. The flawless faces, immaculate homes and wildly successful careers mesmerize us and we tend to compare that with our own flawed condition. This constant comparison can fuel our desire to be perfect, or at least appear to be. Nobody likes failing, right? Sometimes the pursuit of perfection is driven by fear of making mistakes, being judged, or not measuring up to the societal expectations. We always think like, ‚ÄúIf I aim high enough, I‚Äôll minimize the chances of making mistakes or failing‚Äù. This fear can drive us to strive for flawlessness as a kind of defense mechanism, a way to shield ourselves from negative feedback. üçÇ The problem begins when this pursuit of perfection becomes obsessive, leading to self-destructive behaviours. Impossibly high standards lead to disappointment, anxiety, stress, exhaustion and frustration. Furthermore, the fear for flawlessness, hinder us from taking risks and embracing new challenges. Excess of anything is harmful. Our society stresses on achievement, success and flawlessness. We are constantly subjected to the idealized representations of reality, from the doctored images in magazines to the meticulously curated perfection on social media, influencing our perceptions. These images create unrealistic expectations and contribute to a culture of comparison, fueling our desire to measure up to these often unattainable standards. The pressure to excel in academics, career, and even in personal life further reinforces this pursuit of perfection. Many people have high standards and a strong sense of responsibility, which can lead them to strive for perfection in their endeavors. By meticulously planning and executing tasks, we may feel like we can manage outcomes and avoid unwanted surprises. They may feel a deep sense of satisfaction from doing things to the best of their ability. The ambitious nature pushes us to learn and grow. But sometimes, this drive can tip over into perfectionism, where we set impossibly high standards and become overly critical of ourselves. Also, falling short of unrealistic expectations can negatively impact our self esteem. For some of us, perfectionism can be linked to seeking approval and validation. We believe that being perfect will earn us the love and acceptance we crave, we might become obsessed with achieving that ideal. It‚Äôs a way of trying to control how others perceive us, even though it‚Äôs often based on flawed assumptions. Many people think of perfectionism as striving to be your best, but it is not about self-improvement; it‚Äôs about earning approval and acceptance. -Brene Brown The pursuit of perfection can actually be counterproductive. When we‚Äôre so focused on being perfect, we can become paralyzed by fear of making mistakes. We might procrastinate, avoid taking risks, or become overly stressed and anxious. Ironically, this can hinder our progress and prevent us from achieving our goals. Continuos hard work can often lead to exhaustion and burnout. Celebrating our small wins and learning from mistakes enables us to shift our focus from perfection to progress. As Alexander Pope aptly said, ‚Äúto err is human, to forgive divine‚Äù Embrace imperfection and recognize that it‚Äôs a natural part of the human experience. It also helps to reframe our definition of success. Instead of focusing solely on the outcome, we can appreciate the process and effort we put in. Did we learn something new? Did we overcome a challenge? Those are valuable achievements, even if the end result wasn‚Äôt \"perfect.\" Ultimately, striving for excellence is a good thing, but chasing perfection is a recipe for disappointment. By embracing imperfection and focusing on growth, we can free ourselves from unnecessary pressure and live more fulfilling lives.

      "Imagine you're sitting in a doctor's office, feeling perfectly healthy, and then you hear the words: \"You have cancer.\" It's shocking. Every day, 60,000 people face this same unexpected reality. Most people diagnosed with cancer say the same thing: \"I felt perfectly healthy.\" They didn't realize cancer had been slowly growing inside them for a long time. I have some terrible news: You have a1 in 5 chanceof getting cancer in your lifetime, and millions of your cells become cancerous every day. But wait before you panic; your immune system destroys most of these cells before they can cause harm. But here's the catch: It's far more complicated than it seems. Even if abdominal cancer surgeries are some of the most challenging and exciting I've performed. And despite all our training and research ‚Äî doctors still don't fully understand cancer. Cancer is both terrifying and fascinating to study. Cancerous cells are brilliant and relentless, with one clear mission:replicate at all costs. Cancer is a hidden enemy that escapes your body's defences and finds new ways to do so, making it one of medicine's biggest challenges. At its simplest, your cells have one job: they work and replicate, and when they can no longer perform their role, they die. Depending on where they are in your body, they may or may not be replaced by younger, healthier cells. The real problem with cancer is that malfunctioning cells don't follow the rules. Usually, these damaged cells would be flagged by your body's police force ‚Äî your immune system ‚Äî and removed. Even more shocking, cancer cells find a way to: Now, imagine immortal, malfunctioning cells multiplying at a crazy pace, completely unchecked by your body's defences. This buildup of dangerous cells forms what we call atumour. Initially, these tumours grow locally, confined to one area. As the cancer cells pile up, they encourage each other to grow and replicate while evading the immune system. When the tumour becomes large enough, it invades nearby healthy tissues and causesregional growth. My colleagues and I can usually remove the tumour at this stage, even if it is challenging. Still, that's precisely for situations I'm getting paid for, and I like it. But here's where it gets tricky: Cancer cells have a unique ability ‚Äî they can take highways through your body to spread. This process is calledmetastasis. There are two main routes cancer cells can simultaneously use: At this point, treatment becomes more complicated. Surgery becomes less relevant in the early phase of the treatment. Usually, we try to eliminate metastasis with systemic treatments beforehand. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible progress in treating advanced cancer. Metastasis no longer means the end ‚Äî it just means the treatment needs more personalization. But the big question remains. Damage occurs when the cell's DNA is altered. Cell DNA acts as the user manual for how your cell works. When that manual is damaged, the cell develops DNA mutations, which cause it to malfunction. There are two ways a cell can get damaged: Purely genetic cancers are caused by inherited damage. It's like receiving an altered manual the moment you're born. Cancers appear earlier in life because aggressive mutations are found and cause rapid accumulation of DNA damage. Sporadic cancers, on the other hand, are caused by acquired damage over time. Cancers show up much later. Bad habits usually cause this type of DNA mutation. For example (to name a few): Those are seen over long-term exposition, causing chronic inflammation and creating a sustained environment of oxidative stress, which continuously damages the cell's DNA, causing mutation and, over time, cancer. Usually, your immune system would step in, recognize the damaged cell, and remove it. But cancer cells are smarter than you think. The more damage a cell accumulates, the more its DNA gets altered. Cancer cells develop new ways to do whatever they want with each change. Remember, this cancerous cell does not follow any rules anymore. It can now: It's like a snowball effect: as damage builds, cells become more challenging to control. And here is how they do it. Cancer cells develop their unique characteristics, making them unstoppable by your body's defences: Yes. Thankfully, modern medicine has made incredible miracles. But there's an even better approach: The best way to fight cancer is to prevent it from happening in the first place. Check what screening options are available where you live and take advantage of them. Early detection and prevention willsaveyour life. Cancer is complex, but prevention and early detection are lifesaving. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, small steps like improving your lifestyle and staying up to date on screenings can make all the difference. Your health is worth it.

      "Reforms. Every system, every environment, and everything around us requires change after a certain time. As they say, ‚ÄúChange is the only constant.‚Äù But sometimes, we wonder how often the change is happening.

Recently, Trump announced a major boost for AI infrastructure in the United States, with private companies planning to invest up to $500 billion over the next four years. A new venture, calledStargate, is being launched by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle, according to sources familiar with the deal. Leaders from these companies, including SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman, and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, are expected to join Trump at the White House to make the announcement. The partnership will begin with a $100 billion investment and start its first project ‚Äî a data center in Texas. The plan is to expand to other states over time. Other investors are expected to join, though their identities have not yet been revealed. Stargate aims to create cutting-edge infrastructure to support AI development in the U.S. While spokespeople for SoftBank and OpenAI have not commented, this massive initiative signals a strong push to position the U.S. as a leader in AI technology. Which means AI gets funded, and every crazy idea of AI can be a reality of our future. I appreciate the funding, but when you have the power to drive innovation and lack the core fundamentals of human life and the struggles of humankind, it feels like a disconnect.

      "Abortion has always been a topic of heated debate in the United States and is still full of contention and emotion. On a fundamental level, it sets women's right to decide on their body against the moral area that deals with questions like, \"When does life start?\"\" Abortion is the right to conclude about one's own body even three times over, while, on the other hand, it is the right to morals and the legality of the act of abortion. Critics, who tend to liken it to legalizing murder, may press their point about the disparity to characterize that provisional empowerment is the wrong method for managing the situation. The US history of abortion rights is characterized by significantly changing laws. The ruling, Roe v.

      "The idea of a global health organization predates the establishment of theWHO. In the late 19th century, international efforts to combat diseases like cholera and yellow fever laid the groundwork for cooperation across borders. However, it wasn‚Äôt until the aftermath of World War II that global leaders recognized the need for a central organization to address health issues on a worldwide scale. TheWHOwas officially established on April 7, 1948, a date now celebrated annually as World Health Day. With 61 countries signing its constitution, the WHO marked the beginning of a unified approach to tackling global health challenges. The WHO‚Äôs vision is ambitious yet simple: ‚ÄúHealth for All.‚Äù This encapsulates its mission to ensure that all people have access to essential healthcare services without suffering financial hardship. Its objectives include: The WHO emphasizes collaboration, working with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other stakeholders to achieve its goals. TheWorld Health Organization‚Äôs work spans a broad spectrum of activities aimed at improving global health. Here‚Äôs a closer look at its key functions: The WHO develops guidelines and standards that influence health practices worldwide. For example, it publishes the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a critical tool for tracking and diagnosing diseases. The WHO plays a pivotal role in eradicating and controlling infectious diseases. Its notable successes include the eradication of smallpox in 1980 and its ongoing efforts to eliminate polio. The organization also leads campaigns against malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, providing funding, resources, and technical expertise. During health crises such as pandemics, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks, the WHO steps in to coordinate international responses. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the WHO distributed over 1 billion doses of vaccines through the COVAX initiative, saving countless lives. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are leading causes of death globally. The WHO advocates for preventive measures, such as reducing tobacco use, encouraging physical activity, and promoting healthy diets. The WHO is committed to reducing maternal and child mortality rates. Through programs like the Every Woman Every Child initiative, it ensures better access to prenatal care, safe childbirth, and nutrition for mothers and children. Recognizing mental health as an integral part of overall well-being, the WHO works to destigmatize mental illness and improve access to mental health services. Its global mental health action plan emphasizes the need for early intervention and support systems. One of the WHO‚Äôs most celebrated accomplishments is the eradication of smallpox. Through a coordinated vaccination campaign, the disease was officially declared eradicated in 1980, saving millions of lives. Although polio remains endemic in a few regions, the WHO‚Äôs Global Polio Eradication Initiative has brought the world closer to eradicating this crippling disease. For example, cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988. The WHO has been instrumental in the fight against HIV/AIDS. By advocating for antiretroviral therapy and prevention programs, it has significantly reduced the disease‚Äôs impact in many countries.Read More -- -- <a href=\"https://www.myreview24.com/\"> Read Movie Reviews, Entertainment News, Home & Kitchen, Net Worth, News, Trending Topics, Fashion and more</a> Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

A primitive root; to rest (as at home); causatively (through the implied idea of beauty, to celebrate (with praises) ‚Äî keep at home, prepare habitation. Treasuring thefirsttime seeing the result of his labor from whacking thick pods with a knife and piling the milky beans in a heap before drying later for shipment, an older guy, as he sat among workers, mostly in flip-flops and dingy shirts, held the unwrapped chocolate bar up to talk, basking in his moment of glory. Impatiently, their hands reached out until he mentioned his obligation as the eldest to taste what the stranger had given him. When he finally indulged himself, the sweetness immediately spread across his lips into a smile. Earlier, another laborer, prompted by a flashing notion, had shared what he thought with others, one of several comments the group associated with eating chocolate. ‚ÄúThis is why white people are so healthy.‚Äù Saving the wrapper in his pocket after passing the rest to others, the eldest there declared that he would take it home to show to his family, so proud of his discovery of chocolate, a delicacy forcenturiesin many parts of the world, especially oncecompaniespoured in enough milk and sugar to keep dentists and physicians in business, as patients succumbed to cavities and a litany of diseases from obesity. Count me as one of the many who enjoyed those delectable desires sweetened for addiction. Switching over gradually to the kind without any added sweetness took years before I got used to the taste. Even now, I chase that bitterness down with a banana or a pinch of raisins and constantly keep an eye on the scale, adjusting daily desires by the ounce, because I treasure good health. Otherwise, I‚Äôd eat up a few sizes from all the frigid temperatures that have kept me in this season. Jazzed bysnow, the most, from what I read online, since Valentine‚Äôs of 1895, Fat Tuesday came early for strollers in New Orleans, as unseemly weather shut down the city, while also giving mothers a reason to celebrate with their kids who, like that guy tasting chocolate first, smiled wide at the sight of soft mounds piling atop cars and layering lawns everywhere ‚Äî a memory imprinted forever in a treasured click for a photo album, adding to the joy from a day off from schoolwork. First times, as well as final ones, occupy a special place that we embrace more emotionally than whatever happened before or afterward ‚Äî whether in a tasted desire or prized memory. Memories of those first moments often last throughout life, adding layers of context for comparison as we mature and grow through the years. Once we add similar moments, that original impression slowly depreciates until it loses its luster, the charm of what made it precious in the first place. Eyes that once dazzled look elsewhere now at a dinner table. Instead of connecting deeply to refresh the feeling that we promised to hold on to forever, we slip into going through the motions of just another habit ‚Äî a hug without meaning more, just another piece of chocolate for our lips. Valentine‚Äôs Day, as well as a couple of other days throughout the year, particularly the annual sale of Leonidas Chocolate, usually brings on an urge for me to resist perhaps my favorite temptation for a delicacy. However, a frozen winter of singleness has one advantage going for it ‚Äî buying less processed chocolate to sprinkle in for a random occasion, especially with fewer bouquets of scented petals that wilt by the week. Despite missing out on delectable treats that whet my appetite each year, I manage to flavor bitter nibs daily and savor them with fruit to suit my taste. Consequently, I refresh an edible joy that keeps me coming back for more each day, though rather hard-pressed to remember that first taste of chocolate ever. If I reacted similarly to the man in the video after that first bite of chocolate, my impression faded quickly amid sweetness packaged on shelves easily within reach, perhaps in preparing me for a world filled with irresistible eye candy often painted on lips. This morning‚Äôs reading treasures wisdom that knows which desires mean more and which pleasures require greater self-discipline. Each day, we encounter a new opportunity to improve on the day before or just drift back to the pack of mediocrity ‚Äî that first nibble for a taste of what lies ahead or fresh snow for a memory in years to come.

      "Digital health startups are obsessed with technology, but what if the real competitive edge lies in skills that can‚Äôt be coded? In an industry dominated by groundbreaking tech innovations ‚Äî AI-driven diagnostics, telehealth platforms, and wearable devices ‚Äî it‚Äôs easy to think that technical prowess is the only ingredient for success. Yet, countless startups fail not because their tech wasn‚Äôt good enough but because their leaders lacked the ability to connect, empathize, and inspire. Many believe that mastering technology and innovation is the single most important skill for digital health leaders. After all, a groundbreaking app or a revolutionary AI model is what attracts funding and headlines. But here‚Äôs the catch: digital health is not just about technology; it‚Äôs about people. Whether it‚Äôs convincing healthcare providers to adopt your solution, navigating regulations, or earning the trust of patients, soft skills often outweigh technical brilliance. In fact, startups with exceptional technology often fail to scale because leaders struggle with the ‚Äòpeople‚Äô side of the business. To be fair, no one can lead a digital health startup without some level of technical expertise. A leader who understands the technology and its potential is crucial. However, technology alone can‚Äôt explain why some startups thrive while others crumble. It‚Äôs the ability to empathize with users, inspire teams, and build strategic partnerships that sets successful leaders apart. Think about this: would you trust a health tech leader who can build an app but struggles to communicate its value to patients? Or one who can design a wearable but can‚Äôt address the concerns of a doctor hesitant to adopt it? In digital health, success depends as much on the trust and buy-in you build as on the innovation you deliver. Technology will always be a cornerstone of digital health, but it‚Äôs time we recognized that leadership is about more than algorithms and code. Communication, empathy, and relationship-building are not optional ‚Äî they‚Äôre essential.

      "Christine Dimmick Jan 16, 2025 Yesterday with much fanfare it was announced that Red dye #3 was banned by the FDA in food products. The dye was alreadybanned in 1990in cosmetics for causing cancer in lab rats who ingested it. Fast forward 35 years, to yesterday, when it is finally banned in food, when we knew all along it caused cancer ifeaten. It was also‚Äúrestricted‚Äùin the EU in 1994, with allowance in cocktail cherries, aka Maraschino cherries. Maraschino cherries ‚Äî a preserved, candied cherry,originally never used dye in the first place. Created in Europe, the spirit companyLuxardo(who claims ownership), released them in 1821, using alcohol and sugar as the preservative. Eventually the cherries made their way to the US and then prohibition happened. in the 1920s, a professor in Oregon created his own version using calcium salts and brine as a preservative, which removed the coloring, so he added back coloring, artificially, giving them their bright red color. This colorant was banned in the 60s for causing cancer, so manufacturers started using another artificial colorant ‚Äî Red 40, which also causes cancer and neurological issues in humans. Red 40 is still used today in Maraschino cherries and many other foods and drinks and cosmetics. Let‚Äôs review. I am going to make this short and sweet. Just like us, large organizations, governments, charities, corporations also want self preservation, but the want it for the ‚Äúorganizations‚Äù interest aka the shareholders/stakeholders. They may employ humans like you and me, but they employ them to work on their behalf. Why do humans comply? The paycheck they receive serves their own self-interests enough to make them do things they know are not benefiting others. Nothing will change until we demand it. Power is never given back, and rarely is money. If we want to take our power back, we need to take power away from entities who are not protecting us. Growth is not in the ‚Äúbig‚Äù it is found in small, local community efforts where everyone has a say. But even community boards suffer from power trips. We need a system that is easily accessible and readily available to all, to share their voice and be a part of the final decision This won‚Äôt happen how we do it now. We ALL have to work and get involved. We have to read, do research. Social media is not research. Learn to read a medical study. We have to stop looking for a knight in shining armor to save us and also stop looking for it in the same places. The news, the politicians, the experts, the influencers, the pod casters are all geared to grab your interest, your wallet, your trust, your vote. Want to find real leaders? People who will represent us? People who actually will do the right thing? Find the people who aren‚Äôt influenced by money or power.

      "Imagine a world where no parent fears passing down devastating illnesses to their children. A world where individuals don‚Äôt spend their lives battling unlucky congenital illnesses, and the suffering caused by conditions like Huntington‚Äôs disease, cystic fibrosis, or sickle cell disease is a bygone memory. A world freed of catastrophic genetic diseases. This is the extraordinary promise of gene editing, a tool that has the potential to forever alter the trajectory of human health. But alongside this promise lies a chilling possibility: a society where human biology is reshaped to fit arbitrary ideals, putting our long-term health and evolution at risk. A dangerous resurgence of eugenics, where CRISPR places the power of creation into human hands, allowing us to rewrite, and possibly destroy, the fundamental nature of life. While genetic perfection is within reach, this accompanying dystopia is just as close. In 2018,Chinese scientist He Jiankui sent shockwaves through the scientific community with the first attempt to create genetically edited embryos resistant to HIV, resulting in the birth of twin girls(Raposo). Globally,42.3 million people have died from HIV, yet with CRISPR, no more have to (‚ÄúHIV‚Äù). While this trial showcased gene editing‚Äôs revolutionary potential to eradicate disease, it sparked global outrage for ignoring ethical standards.The experiment failed to obtain informed consent from participants, bypassed global ethical review boards, and targeted a medically well-managed condition(‚ÄúWhat are the Ethical Concerns‚Ä¶?‚Äù). A clear case of technological innovation outpacing ethical oversight. But what happens when scientific experimentation isn‚Äôt strictly monitored? In the cases of theTuskegee Syphilis Study,Henrietta Lacks,Nazi medical experiments, and hundreds more: Catastrophe. This same gene-editing technology, if unchecked, has the potential to resurrect the horrors of Nazi eugenics on an unprecedented scale. What happens when we cross the line from disease prevention to human enhancement? Prioritizing traits like beauty, athleticism, and intellect over necessity shifts the focus from saving lives to perfecting them ‚Äî a dangerous pursuit with profound consequences for human evolution and survival. Evolution thrives on diversity, enabling populations to adapt to new environments and diseases.A 2018 study on the adaptation of a chytrid parasite proved this concept, illustrating that genetic diversity in the host population limits pathogens‚Äô adaptation ability, making populations more resistant to disease(Agha et al.). Narrowing the genetic pool through enhancements would leave humans more vulnerable to disease and destabilize long-term adaptability, contradicting the natural process of evolution for reproductive fitness. However, the transformative benefits of genetic engineering for disease prevention are undeniable. This technology could end generations of suffering.Genome mutations cause roughly 7,000 known diseasesin the human body, affecting hundreds of millions of people and their families (‚ÄúUsing gene editing to fight deadly genetic diseases‚Äù). CRISPR technology enables scientists to correct these mutations, and for the first time in history, eliminate catastrophic diseases such as Huntington‚Äôs disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This technology holds the power to save millions of lives, and as it becomes more affordable ‚Äîcurrent treatment costs of $2.2 million reflect the high expense of novel technologies‚Äî it has the potential to revolutionize public health by reducing the burden of chronic illnesses that strain healthcare systems worldwide (Pagliarulo and Lucas). Unfortunately, humans won‚Äôt stop at disease eradication. If we have the potential to create the smartest, healthiest, and most physically capable society, why wouldn‚Äôt we? Enhancements ignore the intricate web of genetic interactions that define human traits, oversimplifying how genes work together to shape characteristics. Targeting an isolated gene assumes it can be modified without unintended consequences, yet in the human genome, traits are interconnected; a single gene codes for far more than one outcome. Take theCCR5-Œî32 mutation, which Chinese scientist He Jiankui attempted to engineer in the twin girls(Sanders). This mutation prohibits HIV infection, yetincreases susceptibility to West Nile virus and leads to a 21% higher overall mortality rate(Sanders). This is the reality of genetics: nothing exists in isolation. Eugenics disregards this complexity and destabilizes finely tuned systems that evolution has optimized throughout history, leading to unpredictable health consequences ranging from heightened disease susceptibility to extinction of entire lineages. Additionally,enhancements could exacerbate global health disparities and widen socioeconomic divides, as this technology would remain out of reach for communities carrying the highest disease burdens(‚ÄúAccelerating Global Access to Gene Therapies‚Äù). While disease prevention may be disproportionately accessible, it carries the potential to address urgent health crises and reduce suffering globally. Enhancements, however, are not medically necessary. What may benefit a privileged few will inevitably deepen societal divides and amplify dangerous inequalities. Such pursuits are simply indefensible. What is the true cost of progress? When ambition disregards ethics and humanity is treated as an experiment, who bears the burden? Well, let‚Äôs review a familiar example. What did He Jiankui earn from his revolutionary experiment? Prison. Reckless application of CRISPR technology highlights the danger of operating without enforceable safeguards. But on the verge of biological instability, evolutionary collapse, and exacerbated socioeconomic inequality, is jailing after the fact enough? If genetic enhancements become normalized, the blame will no longer rest on a single scientist ‚Äî it will fall on a divided, homogenized, and deteriorating humanity. The stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.The World Health Organization has taken steps by establishing a genome-editing registry and oversight mechanisms(‚ÄúHealth Ethics & Governance‚Äù). Without enforcement, these measures are futile. CRISPR holds the power to transform lives, curing diseases once thought insurmountable. But if left unchecked, it could destabilize the foundation of human biology and evolution. This isn‚Äôt just a conversation for scientists, physicians, and policymakers. As a global community, will we let this technology become a tool for artificial perfection and irreversible destruction, or will we champion it as a force for healing? The choice ‚Äî and the responsibility ‚Äî belongs to all of us.

      "In discussions about America‚Äôs most pressing health crises, cancer often dominates the spotlight. Yet, in its shadow lies a silent and rapidly growing threat: cardiodiabesity. This complex convergence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity represents more than just a medical condition. It‚Äôs a looming public health and economic crisis with far-reaching consequences. Research by Evernorth reveals a startling statistic: 93% of adults in the United States suffer from suboptimal health linked to these interconnected conditions. This figure underscores the pervasiveness of the issue, as cardiodiabesity touches nearly every corner of society. The rise in obesity alone illustrates the scope of this epidemic. Between 1999 and 2020, adult obesity rates soared from 30.5% to 41.9%. If current trends persist, half of all American adults could be classified as obese by 2030. But this is far from a superficial issue ‚Äì it sets off a chain reaction of health problems, magnifying risks for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The financial burden of cardiodiabesity is staggering, with an estimated cost of $719 billion annually. To put this into perspective, consider Sarah, a 45-year-old marketing professional juggling a demanding job and family obligations. Her busy lifestyle led to stress-induced overeating and minimal exercise, culminating in obesity. Over time, she developed type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, conditions that now place her at significant risk for heart disease. Sarah‚Äôs story mirrors that of millions of Americans. Collectively, the costs associated with obesity ($173 billion), heart disease and stroke ($219 billion), and diabetes ($327 billion) highlight the monumental economic impact of these conditions. These expenses include not only direct medical costs but also lost productivity ‚Äì making cardiodiabesity one of the most expensive challenges facing the healthcare system today. While individual health behaviors contribute to the crisis, the roots of cardiodiabesity extend far deeper. Social and economic factors account for 40% of health outcomes, according to public health data. These include access to nutritious food, safe environments for physical activity, and economic stability ‚Äì all of which shape an individual‚Äôs ability to maintain good health. The physical environment plays a smaller but still significant role (10%), while clinical care and individual health behaviors account for 20% and 30%, respectively. This breakdown reveals the importance of addressing broader systemic factors rather than placing the burden solely on personal responsibility. ‚ÄúIt is better to prevent than to cure. ‚Äì Ibn Sina‚Äù The encouraging news is that cardiodiabesity is largely preventable ‚Äì and, in many cases, reversible. Early intervention and comprehensive health strategies have shown promise in disrupting the cycle of these interconnected conditions. A variety of tools and approaches are making a difference, from digital health platforms to workplace wellness programs. Take, for instance, the initiative led by Cigna Healthcare in partnership with Virgin Pulse. By allowing employees to tailor their health experiences, set achievable goals, and engage in friendly competition with colleagues, such programs emphasize proactive health management over reactive treatment. Statistics and policy discussions often obscure the personal toll of cardiodiabesity. Families bear the emotional weight when loved ones grapple with chronic conditions, while careers and personal aspirations are frequently derailed. The impact extends beyond physical health, affecting mental well-being, self-esteem, and relationships. Addressing cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a moral imperative ‚Äì it‚Äôs an economic one. Companies that invest in employee wellness programs often see measurable returns through reduced healthcare costs and higher productivity. On a national scale, coordinated efforts to combat cardiodiabesity could yield significant savings while improving quality of life for millions. Much like the fight against cancer, tackling cardiodiabesity requires a unified approach. Healthcare providers, employers, policymakers, and individuals all have a role to play. Integrated treatment strategies, supportive regulatory frameworks, and community-based health initiatives are essential components of a comprehensive solution. The stakes are enormous. Cardiodiabesity isn‚Äôt just a set of disconnected health problems ‚Äì it‚Äôs a tightly woven crisis that affects nearly every aspect of American life, from families to workplaces to entire communities. This is not a challenge we can address piecemeal or delay for another generation. If we fail to act, millions will continue to face shortened lives, mounting medical bills, and preventable suffering. We‚Äôve seen what coordinated action can do in the face of major health threats like cancer or heart disease. It‚Äôs time to bring that same urgency and focus to cardiodiabesity. The longer we wait, the more lives and resources we lose to a crisis that we already know how to address. This isn‚Äôt just about statistics ‚Äì it‚Äôs about people, families, and futures that don‚Äôt have to be cut short. The responsibility to address this crisis can no longer be postponed. -- -- 1 CEO and Founder of Nudge Health Visit us atwww.mynudgehealth.com Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

      "The lost art of finding your own Food For me foraging is a fascination. Growing up in the UK, I was led to believe that interesting food was ‚Äòexotic‚Äô food. Tropical fruit, spicy curries, fragrant broths. But discovering that the UK is home to some seasonal delicacies ‚Äî free of charge, and, for the most part easy to identify and pick safely, sparked my imagination.

This is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to people‚Äôs questions and concerns about foraging. But, while the ancient practices around finding and identifying edible plants has been all but lost in many communities, there is a group of people who have made it their mission to preserve the knowledge by learning, recording and teaching about the art of hunting for wild food in the UK.

Alcohol has been around forever and will be around for a long time. Some people are able to drink a glass occasionally for celebration and many people can not. Those are the people who I see as an addiction nurse. People who suffer from trauma, and pain, got into the notion of covering the pain by drinking alcohol to numb the painful memories. I had seen people become addicted to alcohol as a child as they were given regular drinks by parents, aunts, abusers, and more. A devastating cycle. I believe everyone deserves a chance to get out of addiction. I believe addiction is not a choice. People can easily get lost in the path down on the addiction road and can find it very difficult to get out. Many people drink socially feeling they need to do so to follow the societal norm. I am one of those people who does not follow the crowd when it comes to alcohol consumption. I have lost too many friends, family, and patients because of alcohol.

      "We have all heard the saying countless times, ‚ÄúMONEY IS THE ROOT OF EVIL.‚Äù This is often misquoted from the actual saying, ‚ÄúTHE LOVE OF MONEY IS THE ROOT OF EVIL.‚Äù People use the former quote to see all people who are rich or wealthy as evil. They use this as an excuse to say why they don‚Äôt work to be financially free. They use this as an excuse to say they are remaining humble. They use this as an excuse to say why they are stagnant in life. They continuously lie to themselves and others around them. People who look at the wealthy and envy them don‚Äôt realize they are envious because they themselves love money and want it for themselves. People who judge the wealthy don‚Äôt realize they themselves would choose to be wealthy if given the chance. I do not say that some wealthy people didn‚Äôt achieve that by wrong and immoral means, which shows their love for money, but those who put God first and work hard for years to get to where they are are blatantly and ignorantly grouped into this single category of ‚Äúall the rich are evil.‚Äù Their hard work, their sacrifices, their losses ‚Äî are all ignored. Some people put themselves first as the reason for chasing wealth, while others put those around them as their reason. Some people look at the world and want to do better for their family, their loved ones, and those less fortunate around them, and so they do not fall in love with the money itself, but with the potential it has to do great things for those around them. Being unwealthy doesn‚Äôt make you better in any way than someone who is. What matters truly is your heart.

      "Access to birth control is the touchstone of reproductive health and personal autonomy, yet it remains highly divisive across societies. Public control over access to birth control is the ability of every individual to obtain advanced contraception without cost, stigma, or the effect of restrictive laws. But the whole need has now come to the forefront for public debate again due to recent political and social developments. Family planning, education, and economic stability dot an individual‚Äôs pathway to health through birth control. Studies proved that contraception access significantly mitigates unintended pregnancies and improves maternal and child health outcomes. Millions yet face hurdles when accessing birth control, which is ironic considering merchandise that holds such great benefits. Economic inequality, inadequate health infrastructure, and barriers to sociopolitical factors are preventers of section marginalized communities from accessing contraceptive service. Public control here is calling for policies catering to equality that‚Äôs priority for accessibility. Governments should subsidize funding into such programs, promote comprehensive sex education, as well as fight against stigma at birth control. This also has to relate with legal protection towards preventing the rollback of reproductive rights, which is yet another issue fast growing across certain regions.

      "Why Parents Should Include Their Children In Organized Sports It‚Äôs important that parents put their kids in organized sports while growing up as it has many benefits such as maintaining strong health, heightened concentration in school, as well as psychological and social benefits as they progress into adulthood. I can vouch that sports have shaped the person I am today and helped me overcome the obstacles I encountered while growing up. When my parents separated and went through the divorce process, sports were a pivotal outlet for me. It was an area of freedom and fun away from my outside life. As a young adult who has suffered from anxiety and depression since I was thirteen due to the things happening with my family, I can say without a doubt that sports saved me. Many of my fondest memories and accomplishments came from being in sports, like scoring the game winning goal with thirty-one seconds left my junior year to be crowned the league champions with my soccer team. I don‚Äôt get the best moment of my life without organized sports. For starters, physical activity helps maintain strong health. Exercising is one of the best ways to keep children in shape and to help prevent diseases and illnesses. (National Institutes of Health, 2016). Studies showed that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of injuries, different types of cancer, including breast and colon cancer, as well as reducing risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure. The American Journal of Preventive Medicine said after school physical programs have reduced obesity the most. Having your kids stay active would help reduce lower medical care as they would be healthier more often which also results in less financial burdens. As mothers and fathers, one of your main goals in life is to always keep your kids safe, and having kids in organized sports keeps your kids healthy which helps towards that goal. Kids participating in organized sports growing up have shown to translate into benefits in the learning environment. A study that followed children from kindergarten to fourth grade showed that physical activities help children to develop and improve their cognitive skills. It has been associated with children getting better grades and doing better on standardized tests. Physical activity has also been shown to improve attitudes and academic behavior including ‚Äúenhanced concentration and attention‚Äù (GAO, 2012). Sports have always motivated me to have higher concentration in my academics to make sure I maintained solid grades. My parents would not allow me to participate in my sports if my grades weren‚Äôt good. That extra incentive while growing up helped me especially in middle school to stay focused and committed to getting good grades. Those good grades alongside sports helped me get admitted into a selective prep high school. Studies on the high school age group showed that teenagers who participated in sports are more likely to attend college and get degrees than non-athletes. Studies have shown that sports can have beneficial effects on individuals even into their adulthoods, which explained that the benefits extend into the workplace. A survey of 400 female corporate executives found that 94% played a sport growing up and 61% said it beneficially impacted their career success. (EY Women Athletes Business Network/espnW, 2014). Additionally, physical activity has also been proven to have a positive impact on mental health and social skills. Kids who are involved in physical activity have reported to have more excitement, more happiness and motivation in their day to day lives, whereas kids who are inactive reported greater nervousness, anxiety, depression, and worry. Physical activity has been shown to boost self-esteem, leadership, and goal-setting skills. A 2019 study found that children who reported to have no physical activity in their life were twice as likely to have mental health issues. According to the United Nations, sports have been proven to provide a safe environment and community for many participants. They may be having trouble at school or having issues at home. Organized sports have helped kids find an outlet from their everyday lives. It helps unite these kids to learn how to work together in a manner that also teaches them to learn the value of teamwork and respect. Additionally, it helps teach children at a young age to develop a passion for something. I fell in love with soccer and basketball when I was three. I developed many of the friendships and relationships I hold dear to this day. The community I fostered at a young age never faltered. I still reach out to old coaches I have had in the past for advice and guidance. I still keep in touch with old teammates and all of us wish each other success and happiness whenever we see one another accomplishing the goals we set when we were younger. I acknowledge that organized sports as the years progress the cost to participate also increases. There‚Äôs a fee for equipment, travel cost, hotel and food. My parents paid for me to play club soccer from age ten to eighteen. Countless practices and games. Many tournaments required us to travel to different states. Different jerseys, shorts, and socks each and every year. I agree that it can add up. When I spoke to my parents, I had asked them if they regretted any of it and they said no. They were just proud of where their daughter is today.

      "There‚Äôs a weight that settles deep within you, one that no amount of sleep seems to lift. You try to rest, to let go, but the moment you close your eyes, the thoughts come rushing in.Did I do enough today? Did I say the right thing? What about tomorrow?It‚Äôs like trying to swim in quicksand ‚Äî the harder you fight, the deeper you sink. Rest isn‚Äôt just lying down; it‚Äôs surrendering, and for some of us, surrender feels dangerous. The silence of stillness can be deafening, amplifying all the doubts and fears we‚Äôve spent the day trying to drown out. We tell ourselves we‚Äôll rest later, after we‚Äôve done more, fixed more, achieved more. But later never comes, and the exhaustion grows, until even the idea of rest feels impossible. Somewhere along the way, we learned to equate rest with laziness, with failure.If you stop, you‚Äôll fall behind.If you rest, you‚Äôre weak.These lies become our truth, and we wear our exhaustion like a badge of honor, proof that we‚Äôre working hard, trying hard, living hard. But deep down, we know the truth: we‚Äôre breaking. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôve convinced yourself that your worth is tied to how much you do, how much you give, how much you endure. It‚Äôs hard to rest when you‚Äôre afraid of what might surface in the quiet ‚Äî the fears you‚Äôve buried, the grief you‚Äôve ignored, the parts of yourself you‚Äôve been too scared to face. Just like your heart needs a beat of silence between every pulse, you need moments to pause, to breathe, to simply exist without expectation. Rest isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness; it‚Äôs an act of courage. It‚Äôs saying,I choose to care for myself, even when the world tells me I shouldn‚Äôt. And yes, it‚Äôs terrifying. Slowing down feels like losing control. But control is an illusion anyway. The world will keep spinning whether you‚Äôre running yourself into the ground or taking a moment to recover. The difference is, when you choose rest, you give yourself a chance to heal, to rebuild, to carry on without breaking completely. So, if you feel like you can‚Äôt stop ‚Äî stop anyway. Not forever, not all at once, but for a moment. Let the world wait. Let the guilt scream and the doubts whisper. Sit with them. Breathe through them. And remind yourself of this truth:you are not your productivity. Your value isn‚Äôt measured by how much you give to others but by the fact that you are here, alive, trying. Even if rest feels impossible now, it‚Äôs not. Start small ‚Äî a breath, a pause, a moment of stillness. You deserve to be whole, not just what‚Äôs left after everyone else has taken their share. You deserve peace, even when the world doesn‚Äôt offer it freely. And most of all, you deserve rest ‚Äî because you‚Äôve carried enough for today. -- -- Navigating mental health, and something about growth.

I am just now healthy enough to write about it. I am not going to shut up about it, because food safety will only get worse under this next administration. Until I am dead, I will not be silenced. Hello Ms. Xxxxxx, I received your information from Xssss Xssssssss, a colleague of yours. He thought you would be the person to direct this story. On August 5th, 2024, my husband and I contracted foodborne botulism. After a night of violent vomiting and other gastrointestinal distress, things turned worse. Within hours, I lost the use of my legs and had shortness of breath. My husband was vomiting as well and had double vision and we were both slurring our words. Something deathly was wrong. We called my brother-in-law, a hospitalist MD out of Xxxxxxx, and he said to go to the emergency room immediately. My father-in-law from Xxxxxxx happened to be in the area visiting his sister and took my husband to Community North. We called an ambulance for me because I couldn‚Äôt move and was gasping for air. We believe we were diagnosed with botulism in a timely manner because we went in together. By all looks of things, my husband, a fifty-year-old, looked like he was having a stroke. What we conjecture is that his symptoms along with my descending paralysis from the head down was how they caught it. By then, the paralysis had reached my diaphragm and I could no longer breathe on my own. By the Grace of God and excellent medical care, a doctor recognized our combined symptoms as botulism. There is a test for botulism, and that takes four days. I think without intervention, I would have been dead within hours. The doctor called the CDC and an anti-toxin was flown in from Chicago. The anti-toxin was administered, and we lived. My husband left the hospital, walking with a cane breathing on his own, in three weeks. My exposure must have been more extreme because I was a lot sicker. After two days of struggling to breath, I was intubated after what can only be categorized as a near death experience. I later had a tracheostomy and breathed through a tube in my neck for eight weeks. It took me a full twelve weeks to recover from the paralysis to walk and talk again. It has been five months, and I still have to walk with a walker. That is one heck of a story, right? So why is our case on the CDC or Indiana Health Department‚Äôs website? I called the Indiana Health Department and they said there has to be at least ten cases in order for it to be worthy of public record. Two cases of botulism are two cases too many. I understand because of HIPPA, that my anonymity is paramount, but so is public health. I am willing to out myself to bring attention to this deadly, but treatable disease. Yes, botulism is rare and only deadly in five percent of cases, if it is caught in time. Many of my doctors and nurses said they haven‚Äôt seen a botulism case in twenty years. That doesn‚Äôt mean that there were unreported botulism because it was not diagnosed in time. Undiagnosed botulism looks like heart failure or unexplained pnemonia. I was lucky and healthy enough to recover. I was lucky to have insurance and to live in Indianapolis with access to top notch health centers like Community North and Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana (RHI). I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to have the forty pounds to lose in two months. I had no underlying conditions. You change one factor, and I‚Äôm dead of suffocation or heart failure in the first twenty-four hours, or I‚Äôm dead of pneumonia in two weeks. I am a miracle of luck and medical science, and no one outside of my inner circle knows about it. I want everyone to know about it. Our food supply chain is already shaky because of monopolies, and I fear with the incoming administration and the overturning of the Chevron decision that essentially weakened Federal agencies, such as the FDA, things will get worse. If my ordeal can make a difference, I am willing to forgo my anonymity for healthcare providers, legislators, and the public to know how to protect themselves when dinner turns deadly. I am looking forward to speaking with you. Sincerely, M*** K***** Botulism Survivor -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",
      "With around ‚Öì of the child population overweight or obese and 40% unable to read at a basic level, I think we can all agree that good health and academic optimization are two things America needs more of (Fiorenzi;Literacy Statistics 2022‚Äì2023). What if I were to tell you that there is a simple action that American schools can take that addresses both health complications and academic hardships? Well, I hope you‚Äôre on the edge of your seat because I want you to get out of it. That‚Äôs right‚Äì stand up, as my research has led me to believe that the solution is standing! American schools should transition to sit-to-stand desks to take advantage of the plethora of benefits to standing instead of sitting, ranging from hindering health issues like diabetes and ADHD to cultivating academic success by improving mood and averting hours of unproductivity. Tens of thousands of hours of every American‚Äôs life is spent at school, and 65‚Äì70% of this time is spent sitting down (Leech;Prepwise).Sitting is the new smoking, you might have heard, and this claim is backed by findings linking health complications such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease to sedentary time (Fiorenzi). Fortunately, standing desks, being on the path to movement, aids in combating each of such complications. Standing burns more calories than sitting, averaging an additional 50 calories per hour in adults, and studies have shown that obese or overweight children burn even more than their healthy-weight peers (Fiorenzi). Standing has been found to reduce blood sugar spikes after meals, a benefit especially helpful for diabetics but good for everyone since ‚Äúgreater amplitudes of glycemic variability have been linked to circulatory oxidative stress‚Äù (Jubbal). Standing is also connected with better heart health, as a study consisting of sitting and standing bus drivers observed that the standing drivers‚Äô risk for heart disease was half of that of the sitting drivers (Leech). If standing were to become the social norm, both the physiological perks and a new social pressure to be healthy enough to stand for longer periods would hinder health complications in the American school population. Consistent with the correlation between better health and academic achievement, sit-to-stand desks provide users with a better learning experience by optimizing key factors to academic success, including productivity, mood, and attention (Kurniawan;Schmidt;Valiente). One of the more obvious perks of a standing desk is postural improvement; good posture naturally reduces back, neck and sciatica pain (Leech). According to astudy, patients suffering from chronic pain had an average reduction of 9.8 hours of work productivity per week. I‚Äôm not sure about you, but I can learn quite a lot in almost 10 hours. A lesser known perk of a standing desk is its effect on mood: a positive one to be more specific. In one study, participants using standing desks reported less stress and fatigue and 87% reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day and after returning to sitting desks their moods reverted to their original levels (Leech). This study complements other research finding sitting and sedentary lifestyles linked with increased risks of depression and anxiety (Leech). As a student, I can attest that maintaining a positive outlook has pushed me to take risks that have led to my own academic success. Although you might have expected that standing desks would create distraction for children, I have found far more evidence suggesting just the opposite. I acknowledge that there is some anecdotal evidence documenting young children bumping into one another while using standing desks, however, recall that chairs create similar distractions including rocking, footsie, and leg swinging (‚ÄúThe Effects of Standing Desks‚Äù). On the other hand, one study demonstrated that students using standing desks exhibited ‚Äúsignificant improvements in attention and inhibitory control compared to their sitting peers,‚Äù and schoolchildren in the experiment group of another study that used standing-desks were found to be between 12 and 25% more engaged than the control group (Fiorenzi;Otto). Dr. Mark Benden of Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Public Health explains this finding well: ‚ÄúWhen kids sit at a desk all day, they don‚Äôt have to use any energy, which means they can just as easily fall asleep, daydream, or distract themselves by distracting others‚Äù (Fiorenzi). At least for me, it ismuchharder to fall asleep standing up. Considering that standing expends more energy than sitting, it‚Äôs logical that distraction would be reduced, a boon particularly for millions of American children diagnosed with ADD or ADHD (Fiorenzi). Hopefully at this point, you‚Äôre convinced that standing desks have immense benefits. You may still be wondering, though, is it worth the effort to replace all sitting desks with standing desks? Allow me to clarify what I mean by ‚Äútransitioning to sit-to-stand desks.‚Äù It‚Äôd be a waste to toss out perfectly adequate sitting desks already owned, but I do think that when schools are in the market for new desks, they should purchase sit-to-stand desks. Sit-to-stand desks allow users to adjust the height of the desk, giving them the option to sit or stand, thereby taking into consideration the needs of physically disabled children and providing flexibility for various activities. Lastly, whereas the monetary price of sit-to-stand desks might be slightly more than that of a sitting-only desk, having the ability to make use of the numerous, substantial advantages of standing sure seem to outweigh that small cost differential. If you believe in having a healthy, educated population, I urge you to use your influence as a student, parent, teacher, staff member, administrator, or alumni to advocate for sit-to-stand desks in your school.

      "Modern medicine has made incredible strides in helping people live longer. But researchers aren‚Äôt just focused on adding years ‚Äî they‚Äôre looking to extend health alongside lifespan. A recent study offers a glimpse into what may be possible: combining two FDA-approved drugs,trametinibandrapamycin, resulted in a significant lifespan increase in mice, while also improving their health in old age. Researchers gave one group of mice trametinib, another group rapamycin, and a third group a combination of the two. The results were striking: ‚Ä¢Trametinib aloneextended median lifespan by7%‚Äì10%, depending on sex. ‚Ä¢Rapamycin aloneincreased lifespan by17%‚Äì18%. ‚Ä¢ Thecombination of both drugsshowed the most dramatic effects, boosting lifespan by35% in femalesand27% in males. What‚Äôs more, the maximum lifespan (the longest any mice lived) increased significantly when both drugs were used together, highlighting their additive benefits. Both drugs target different cellular pathways involved in aging: ‚Ä¢Trametinibworks on a pathway that regulates cell growth. ‚Ä¢Rapamycininhibits a pathway linked to inflammation and age-related diseases. By combining these mechanisms, the drugs created a stronger anti-aging effect than either could achieve alone. Extending lifespan is one thing, but how did the micefeelas they aged? Researchers found the drug combo also improved key markers of health: ‚Ä¢Heart health:Delayed age-related decline in heart function. ‚Ä¢Tumors:Reduced tumor growth and overall tumor load. ‚Ä¢Inflammation:Lowered inflammation in the brain and body. However, it wasn‚Äôt all good news. Some mice experienced side effects like fatty liver disease and testicular degeneration, raising questions about how these drugs might work in humans. Both trametinib and rapamycin are FDA-approved, but for very different uses: ‚Ä¢Trametinibtreats certain types of cancer. ‚Ä¢Rapamycinis used after organ transplants to prevent rejection. The fact that these drugs are already approved opens the door for further research into their potential as longevity treatments. However, what works in mice doesn‚Äôt always translate to humans. Animal studies like this are an exciting starting point, but testing in humans could take decades. Scientists are now exploring whether combining even more drugs ‚Äî like diabetes medications metformin and acarbose ‚Äî could create an even stronger anti-aging effect. The goal is to target multiple cellular pathways to not only extend lifespan but also reduce age-related diseases. But before you get too excited, remember: it‚Äôs still early days. While these findings are promising, the path from lab to human trials is long and full of challenges. This study highlights the potential of drug combinations to unlock new frontiers in longevity research. While human applications are still far off, these findings show that targeting multiple aging pathways could be the key to living not just longer, but healthier lives.

      "A few months ago, I found myself feeling completely out of sync. Life in Washington, D.C. had become overwhelming ‚Äî constant noise, traffic, and endless distractions pulled me away from what truly mattered. I grew up in the countryside, where life was simpler and quieter. That connection to nature, that sense of peace ‚Äî it was missing.

For three months, I lived with monk-like discipline, stripped away distractions, and focused entirely on my personal and professional goals. One of those goals was particularly ambitious: running1,000 miles in a year. When I started Monk Mode, I‚Äôd only scratched the surface. But by the time I was done, I‚Äôd run500 miles in just three months, putting me firmly on track to crush my goal. That‚Äôs the power of Monk Mode.

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt know that citrus fruits can boost the immune system, avoiding colds. But it turns out that citrus fruits have more benefits than that, such as can improve digestion because it contains fiber, can prevent many diseases such as cancer, heart, kidney and even reduce the frequency of asthma attacks because it is anti-inflammatory. OK! Reading those benefits all sound very good. But how long can I eat this much citrus fruit. Unlike the needs of children under 15 years old who only need 50‚Äì65 mg per day. An adult like me needs 75‚Äì90mg of vitamin C intake per day in a fit condition. And one medium-sized orange contains approximately 70mg of vitamin C. Well, that‚Äôs enough for me. One orange a day. The more I search, the more I read. In fact, this fruit can easily be found all over the world. But what if I can‚Äôt find this fruit in some season. The research continues lead me to alternatives.

Apart from guava, papaya and strawberries can be other options that both contain antioxidants that help maintain brain health and flavonoids that are believed to prevent cancer and heart disease. Mangoes are also high in vitamin C, while guavas also contain vitamin A, which has been shown to boost the immune system and eye health. At the end of the research, I was glad.

It must be accepted thatsomehealing is dependent on people and remedies, and there are certainly problems that must be solved by completely submitting the self to the trust of a stranger to do work on you. But if we start early and shift our consciousness to healing the wounds and unhealthy mental patterns that generally lead to ailments, we can do a lot of good for ourselves. Healing starts with the mind and spirit. Especially with mental health, what I‚Äôm about to say in this article is true.

      "Picture this, you‚Äôre scrolling through Instagram and you see a fit man on his porch in Bali, waving his finger at the screen and telling you about a miracle detox tea. He claims that rigorous studies have proved it to increase weight loss by 200%‚Ä¶ Incredible, right? And how helpful of him to include an Amazon affiliate link where you can buy the tea‚Ä¶ Well, since Meta recently announced that they‚Äôll be removing fact-checking from its platforms (Facebook, Instagram, and Threads), you‚Äôre left with the question of how you‚Äôll determine if the miracle tea is a hoax with fabricated statistics or a genuine scientific discovery. In Meta‚Äôs press video, CEO Mark Zuckerberg justifies the decision by saying that fact-checkers were too politically biased, and were making too many false positives ‚Äî taking down posts that didn‚Äôt spread erroneous facts. Additionally, he believes this is a step toward supporting free speech, supposedly a Meta and American value. Whether we resonate with Meta‚Äôs decision or not, those of us who work in healthcare, or merely care about our health, are left wondering where we‚Äôll get our health information from. According to a survey by the National Library of Medicine, 85% of people seek health information using social media, including WhatsApp, YouTube, and Facebook. Although the survey was conducted in Saudi Arabia, it can likely be generalized to most places, since we‚Äôre increasingly chronically online globally. This means we have to be extra cautious about the health information we share and consume online. Without the help of fact-checkers, how can you separate fact from fiction? If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Health improvements take time, consistency, and evidence-based methods. 2. Question the Source Look for advice from credible voices like licensed nutritionists, scientists, or reputable organizations ‚Äî not just influencers with slick branding. AtNutrix AI, we‚Äôre building a platform with evidence-based and easy-to-understand nutrition advice. 3. Ask the Why Behind the Claim When presented with a bold claim, ask: ‚ÄúWhy does this work?‚Äù If the person can‚Äôt explain beyond surface-level buzzwords, treat it as a red flag. For every answer they give, follow up with another ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù 4. Think Twice Before You Share What‚Äôs more dangerous than following ill-advised health advice? Sharing it with all of your friends and followers and putting them in danger too. Pause for a moment before sharing that Instagram reel or sending that message in a WhatsApp group, and ask yourself ‚ÄúHow safe and robust is this claim?‚Äù We live in an era where information is more accessible than ever, empowering billions to make informed decisions about their health. But with this abundance comes the challenge of distinguishing valuable insights from dangerous misinformation. Meta‚Äôs decision to remove fact-checkers doesn‚Äôt have to leave us adrift. Instead, it‚Äôs a call to action: to approach health advice with a critical eye, to rely on trusted sources, and to be mindful of the impact our shares have on others. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",
      "How being delusional can improve or destroy your life. In the past few years, the word ‚Äúdelulu‚Äù has become prominent, particularly within online forums and social media platforms namely Tiktok. Coming from the term ‚Äúdelusional,‚Äù it is commonly used to refer to someone who has a strong belief in an unreasonable or impossible event. This word gave birth to another trending term ‚ÄúDelulu is the solulu‚Äù. This is frequently used to justify or encourage delulu thoughts. ‚ÄúDelulu‚Äù has become an accepted abbreviation for aspirational (and frequently humorous) thinking, whether it‚Äôs the belief that you‚Äôre destined for quick fame or the fantasy that your favourite idol will marry you. Can being ‚Äúdelulu‚Äù be beneficial, though? You may be surprised by the response. Adopting a little ‚Äúdelulu‚Äù thinking in some situations can have unexpected advantages, even if it‚Äôs typically not a good idea to become too disconnected from reality. Believing in an unlikely dream can sometimes motivate you to take action to make it come true.

      "The winter season often makes us forget about hydration. Unlike summer, when thirst is constant, the cold weather masks our body‚Äôs need for water. I experienced this firsthand when I relied solely on coffee and skipped drinking water for nearly ten days. What seemed harmless at first turned into a major health lesson. During winter, I didn‚Äôt feel thirsty and thought coffee was enough to keep me hydrated. The warm comfort of a steaming cup seemed perfect for the season. However, I overlooked the fact that coffee is a diuretic, which means it causes the body to lose water. This routine continued for about ten days, and my body began showing signs of dehydration. My digestive system was the first to react to the lack of water. Here‚Äôs what I faced: By the time I connected the dots, the damage was already done. I realized that the winter chill had tricked me into ignoring water, and coffee had only made things worse. Within a few days, the results were clear: The winter season can make hydration a challenge, but it‚Äôs not something to ignore. My experience taught me that staying hydrated is essential for digestion, energy, and overall health.

      "That is what the urologist told me as I lay on the operating table, wondering how it had come to this. Then almost as an afterthought, she added:‚Äú‚Ä¶that is, if you get to keep them both.‚Äù Before you jump to any conclusions,I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong.I didn‚Äôt take a hit to the groin, try a weird yoga pose, or do anything unusual in the bedroom. It was a normal sunny morning, full of possibilities until it was obliterated by a sudden pain in my left testicle. At first, it was just a twinge, but every time I moved, it got worse. Still, it wasn‚Äôt agony. Definitely not‚Äúrush to the hospital‚Äùterritory. Besides, I had plans. It was a big New Year‚Äôs Eve bash and nothing was going to ruin that. Except, of course, my balls. In the end, the pain became impossible to ignore, and I had to tell my friends I couldn‚Äôt make it out. Luckily, they were supportive and one of them sent me a medical helpline number and told me to call. Naturally, like anyone in need of an expert‚Äôs opinion, I turned to Google. Testicular torsion ‚Äî a condition where the spermatic cord twists, cutting off blood flow to the testicle ‚Äî kept appearing with urgent warnings to act within six hours. But I‚Äôd been in pain all day so I was‚Äútechnically‚Äùsafe. But that wasn‚Äôt the real reason I didn‚Äôt call right away‚Ä¶ The truth is, I have small, some might say (not me) ladylike hands. And I couldn‚Äôt stop picturing dropping my pants and having my dynamic duo manhandled by some ogre of a man‚Äôs giant hands, like a gorilla fumbling with cherries. So, I made the crucial mistake of sleeping on it.‚ÄúIf it still hurts in the morning,‚ÄùI decided,‚Äúthen I‚Äôll call the number.‚Äù So, after a night of very little sleep and multiple testicle-related nightmares, I dialed the helpline. The medical questions came fast, and I was nailing them.‚ÄúNo,‚ÄùI said confidently (and truthfully) to everything: swelling?No.Fever?Nope.The wrong colour?God, no. I was breezing through their questions, and by the time they‚Äôd finished, I felt like I‚Äôd just aced a maths test. ‚ÄúAre you alone?‚Äùthe lady asked, breaking my self-congratulatory haze.‚ÄúI‚Äôm with my parents,‚ÄùI replied.‚ÄúGood, because you need to get to the hospital immediately!‚ÄùMy stomach sank as she delivered the bombshell diagnosis:‚ÄúIt might be testicular torsion.‚Äù As I sat in the car, panic rising in my chest, I couldn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd let something as stupid as my fear of big hands keep me from getting help sooner. Would I really rather lose a ball than let a big-handed man touch me? Apparently, yes. And now I wondered if my hesitation had cost me everything. At the hospital, I found some small comfort in the fact that, so far, only women had been tasked with examining my precious cargo. First, a kind nurse asked a few questions, then a calm technician performed an ultrasound ‚Äî no sign of any gorilla-handed ogre-men. But then the results came back.‚ÄúYou need to get to another hospital,‚Äùthey said.‚ÄúNow.‚Äù Suddenly, I was in an ambulance, sirens blaring, racing toward a urologist who would decide the fate of my crown jewels. That‚Äôs when it hit me: this wasn‚Äôt a joke, and my balls weren‚Äôt going to wait for me to grow up and act like a man. At the next hospital, I met the urologist who explained everything to me in a calm, clinical tone ‚Äî like she could have been talking about fixing a leaky tap instead of performing surgery on one of the most fragile parts of my body. She described how they‚Äôd carve an incision down the centre and take a look inside for signs of necrosis. If it was alive and pink, they‚Äôd untwist it and tie it to the scrotum to prevent future torsions; if it was dead and black, they‚Äôd remove it. ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs in-between?‚ÄùI blurted, as I tried to haggle over my gonads like it was some sort of hostage situation.‚ÄúLike, not dead, but not exactly thriving?‚Äù She stared at me, unimpressed.‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs alive, we keep it. If it‚Äôs dead, we don‚Äôt.‚Äù For a split second, I thought about suggesting,‚ÄúWhat if we just let it heal? Maybe give it some vitamins?‚ÄùBut deep down, I knew I‚Äôd already had my chance to save it. Hanging on to a bad ball could mean losing both, and no amount of wishful thinking could change that, even if it was my favourite one. After one last round of negotiating, where I attempted to micromanage how they‚Äôd tie my man eggs to the sac, they gave me an oxygen mask and the sweet release of unconsciousness. I woke up groggy and in pain with one clear thought:Ouch, my balls. Wait ‚Äî myballs? I‚Äôd never felt happier to say that sentence to myself. The next day, as I was getting ready to leave the hospital, relieved to still have both my boy berries, a male nurse gave me one final check. His hands were massive. And yes, he manhandled my balls. It hurt. A lot. But as he squeezed and twisted my poor orbs, making sure the stitches were good, I realised something important: I‚Äôd rather be manhandled and alive than too scared to act and lose it all. I was one of the rare, extremely lucky cases. Despite delaying my trip to the hospital, I walked away with both testes intact. But not everyone is so lucky. Since my surgery, I‚Äôve spent time onforums exchanging recovery tipswith other people who‚Äôve been through this, and it‚Äôs shocking how many of them ended up losing a ball. One story stuck with me ‚Äî a 14-year-old boy who posted online that he‚Äôd been in excruciating pain for three days and couldn‚Äôt stop throwing up, asking,‚ÄúHow do I tell my parents?‚ÄùBy the time he finally sought out help, it was too late. He was lucky to keep one. It‚Äôs stories like this that remind me how close I came to losing mine and how shame has no place when your health is on the line. Whatever fear or embarrassment is keeping you from seeing a doctor, it‚Äôs not worth the risk. Trust me, if something feels off, don‚Äôt wait. Your balls deserve to be seen, touched, and manhandled.

I had my blood drawn for an annual study I‚Äôve been participating in since 2017. The study aims to determine if specific markers can help detect ovarian cancer earlier in its progression. Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in women and the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers, according to theAmerican Cancer Society. About half of the women with ovarian cancer are 63 or older. Unlike other gynecologic cancers, such as cervical cancer and breast cancer, which have routine screenings like Pap smears and mammograms, ovarian cancer often isn‚Äôt detected until it has advanced, usually by stage III or IV.

      "In the quiet, fleeting moments of love, when two souls are drawn together like stars destined to collide, the world often seems to pause. Their hearts beat in rhythm, as if they were always meant to find each other, to intertwine in a way that nothing, not even time, could undo. For him, a skeptic of anything unseen, and for her, a believer in something beyond the veil, their love was a fragile bridge between two worlds. It was beautiful, but it was also doomed. She wore her faith like a sacred mantle, each prayer, each word, a thread that tied her to her heritage, her family, her God. He, with his agnostic heart, questioned everything, trusting only in what he could see and touch. Yet, in each other‚Äôs presence, they found a connection deeper than the constructs of religion. Their souls recognized one another, something ancient and undeniable, a love that transcended labels and boundaries. But the world they lived in would not let them exist in peace. Her parents whispered in hushed tones, their disapproval a cold, unspoken wall between them. His family, though silent, carried a quiet distance, unable to understand the gravity of a love they deemed impossible. They both knew the truth ‚Äî religion, that sacred force, was the unyielding barrier between them. No matter how deep their feelings, no matter how tender the moments shared, faith would always come first. In the end, love was not enough. They parted, hearts breaking under the weight of what could never be. She prayed for peace; he, for understanding. Yet, neither could escape the excruciating pain of a love that was born to die, a love crushed beneath the weight of faith‚Äôs unrelenting hand. The days after their parting felt like a hollow echo, each moment stretching longer than the last. She would close her eyes and see him, his face etched in the canvas of her memories ‚Äî his smile, the way he held her hand like it was the only thing keeping him grounded. And in those fleeting seconds of nostalgia, the weight of their separation would hit her like a physical blow. She would inhale deeply, hoping the scent of his presence would linger in the air, but it was gone, erased by the rigid walls of tradition and faith that both of them had tried so desperately to climb. For him, the emptiness was no less consuming. He wandered through his days in a fog, every corner of his world now devoid of the warmth she once brought. He questioned everything more now than ever before ‚Äî his beliefs, his doubts, his reality. Was there a God? Was there something greater than this aching void that had taken root in his chest? He could almost feel her ‚Äî her spirit, her soul ‚Äî out there, just beyond his reach. But faith, that ancient force that governed her life and so many others, had come crashing down between them, an insurmountable divide. What hurt the most was the silence that followed their love. It wasn‚Äôt just the absence of her voice or the void where her laughter used to echo. It was the silence of understanding lost, the quiet acknowledgment that what they had wasn‚Äôt enough, not in this world where love and faith couldn‚Äôt coexist without causing a fracture. They had tried ‚Äî oh, how they had tried ‚Äî to find a way. She had hoped that love would bridge the gap, that the raw purity of their connection might challenge the chains of doctrine that bound them. But love wasn‚Äôt enough when the very core of who they were ‚Äî her belief in a higher power and his rejection of it ‚Äî was in direct opposition. She would often catch herself staring at the stars, the same stars that once shone above them both in those stolen moments of joy. The night sky used to feel infinite, a reflection of the boundless love they shared. But now, it was just a reminder of the distance between them, a cruel reflection of the space that had grown between their hearts. In the dark, quiet spaces of the night, he too would look up, seeing only the expanse of the universe, but it felt colder somehow. It felt empty. Love, he thought, shouldn‚Äôt feel like this. It should have been enough. She should have been enough. But how could she be, when everything she held dear was anathema to everything he had come to believe? How could she understand his doubts, the gnawing questions that had no answers, when she was so firmly anchored in a faith he could never share? They had loved with a passion that knew no bounds, but now that same love felt like a cruel, unfulfilled promise. What was the point of all their whispers, their stolen kisses, their shared dreams, when in the end, they were destined to part, unable to break free from the invisible chains that bound them? The pain of that separation would stay with them forever, a scar that would never fully heal. Because sometimes, love is not enough ‚Äî not when the world demands that you choose between your heart and your soul. -- -- Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

      "As someone with 15 years of experience in the health field, I‚Äôve seen countless trends come and go. But there‚Äôs one simple ritual that has truly stood the test of time and has had a profound effect on my health: drinking warm water with turmeric and lemon first thing in the morning. It‚Äôs a combination that many might overlook, but I can tell you from personal experience that this powerful drink has had remarkable effects on my body. It‚Äôs not just about health‚Äîit‚Äôs about feeling energized, clear-headed, and vibrant throughout the day. I will fully explain how I prepare this amazing drink, for maximum effectiveness later below in this article Let me take you through the incredible transformations I‚Äôve experienced, and why I believe you should consider adding this to your daily routine. We all want clear, healthy skin, but what we often forget is that true radiance comes from the inside out. When I first started incorporating turmeric and lemon into my daily routine, I didn‚Äôt expect to see such a noticeable difference in my skin. It wasn‚Äôt just about reducing wrinkles or improving tone‚Äîit was about feeling like my skin was nourished from the inside. Now, almost every morning, as soon as I finish my warm drink, I feel a subtle shift, like my skin is thanking me. Turmeric‚Äôs Healing Touch Turmeric, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, has been a game-changer for my complexion. The active ingredient, curcumin, is a powerhouse of antioxidants, which help protect the skin from the inside. Over time, I noticed fewer breakouts and a significant reduction in redness. As a woman in her mid 30s, I‚Äôve struggled with occasional flare-ups, especially around hormonal changes. But since drinking turmeric regularly, those flare-ups have become much less frequent. I now have smoother skin, fewer blemishes, and it looks much more even. The reduction in redness, especially around my cheeks and chin, has been remarkable. I used to use heavy foundations to hide these blemishes, but now I feel comfortable going makeup-free and just letting my skin breathe. The turmeric not only works to reduce inflammation but also enhances the natural healing process of the skin. If you‚Äôre someone who struggles with conditions like acne or eczema, you‚Äôll understand the struggle of trying various treatments, but trust me when I say that turmeric is a natural, non-invasive solution. Lemon‚Äôs Collagen Boost Then there's the lemon‚Äîrich in vitamin C, which plays a crucial role in collagen production. As we age, our bodies naturally produce less collagen, which leads to sagging skin and wrinkles. However, by drinking lemon water, I‚Äôve found that my skin appears firmer and more youthful. It‚Äôs as if the lemon is helping restore the firmness and elasticity that I noticed was starting to fade. Vitamin C not only boosts collagen but also fights free radicals that cause premature aging. For example, I started seeing fewer fine lines around my eyes and mouth. I have to admit, I‚Äôve noticed that my skin‚Äôs natural glow has returned, and my friends often ask me what my secret is. The combination of turmeric and lemon has given me the radiant, youthful skin I thought I could only achieve through expensive skincare products. As someone who has experienced the highs and lows of different diets and detox programs, I‚Äôve always believed in the power of simple, natural solutions. When I began drinking turmeric and lemon water every morning, it became a ritual that not only helped my skin but also had a positive impact on my entire body. I noticed how light and refreshed I felt, almost like my body had been gently ‚Äúreset.‚Äù This is where the magic of detoxification comes in. Turmeric and Liver Health The liver is your body's detox powerhouse, and turmeric has been shown to support its function. As we age, or even just due to everyday stress, toxins can build up in our bodies. In my experience, turmeric has been a great help in supporting the liver‚Äôs ability to break down these toxins. With the addition of this drink, I felt like my body was able to detoxify more effectively. I no longer felt sluggish or bogged down by the toxic load that sometimes accumulates. Instead, I felt lighter, more energized, and ready to tackle the day. For example, after a long weekend of indulging in rich foods or alcohol, I‚Äôd sometimes wake up feeling bloated and sluggish. Drinking turmeric and lemon water was like pressing the ‚Äúreset‚Äù button for my system. It helped ease bloating and improve digestion, something I‚Äôve truly appreciated. Lemon‚Äôs Role in the Detox Process Lemon, with its high vitamin C and antioxidant content, adds another layer of detox benefits. Lemon helps alkalize the body, supporting the natural processes of detoxification. Over time, I noticed that I wasn‚Äôt just feeling better overall‚ÄîI was eliminating toxins more efficiently, leading to improved digestion and fewer digestive issues. Bloating and uncomfortable fullness, which I used to experience after large meals, became a thing of the past. I felt much lighter, as though my digestive system had been given the support it needed to function at its best. As someone who‚Äôs been active in sports and fitness throughout my life, I‚Äôve had my fair share of joint pain, especially as I‚Äôve gotten older. I first turned to turmeric for its renowned anti-inflammatory properties, and I‚Äôve been amazed at how much it‚Äôs helped with joint pain. After just a few weeks of incorporating turmeric and lemon into my routine, I started feeling a noticeable reduction in discomfort and stiffness, particularly in my knees and lower back. Turmeric‚Äôs Anti-Inflammatory Benefits Curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, works by reducing inflammation in the body. Chronic inflammation is one of the leading causes of joint pain, especially in conditions like arthritis. As I drank my warm turmeric and lemon water every morning, I began to notice that my joints weren‚Äôt as stiff when I woke up. In the past, I used to struggle to get out of bed without a few creaky moments, but that‚Äôs no longer the case. There was a time when I would have to warm up slowly before any workout or even a simple walk. Now, I don‚Äôt feel the same stiffness, and I‚Äôm able to move more freely. My joint pain has been significantly reduced, and even my posture has improved because I don‚Äôt have that constant discomfort weighing me down. Lemon‚Äôs Contribution to Joint Health Lemon‚Äôs role in improving joint health is also significant. Its high vitamin C content supports collagen production, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of cartilage in the joints. As I continued with this daily routine, I noticed that not only did my joints feel better, but I was also less prone to injury. Collagen plays a vital role in joint flexibility, and drinking lemon water regularly helped me maintain that flexibility as I got older. In addition to all of the benefits I've already discussed, one of the most impactful changes I‚Äôve noticed since drinking turmeric and lemon water every morning is a strengthened immune system. As a health expert, I understand how crucial it is to support the immune system, especially in today‚Äôs world where stress and environmental toxins can weaken it over time. The combination of turmeric and lemon provides a powerful boost to your body‚Äôs defenses. Turmeric and Immune Support Turmeric‚Äôs anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties help reduce the strain on your immune system, allowing it to work more efficiently. I‚Äôve noticed that since I started this daily ritual, I‚Äôve had fewer colds and felt more resilient when the flu season came around. It wasn‚Äôt just about preventing illness; it was about feeling more in tune with my body and less vulnerable to external stressors. Lemon‚Äôs Antioxidants Lemon, with its high vitamin C, is another essential part of this immunity-boosting duo. Vitamin C is known for supporting the production of white blood cells, which are crucial for fighting off infections. Over the years, I‚Äôve found that my body‚Äôs ability to fend off colds and viruses has significantly improved. I rarely get sick, and when I do, I recover much faster than I used to. The combined antioxidant power of turmeric and lemon makes this morning drink a must for anyone looking to stay healthy. Another unexpected benefit of drinking turmeric and lemon water first thing in the morning is improved digestion. For years, I struggled with occasional bloating and digestive discomfort. But since incorporating this drink into my daily routine, I‚Äôve found that my digestion has become smoother and more efficient. This, in turn, has had a positive impact on my overall weight management. Turmeric‚Äôs Digestive Benefits Turmeric has long been used to soothe the digestive system. It has natural carnation properties, which means it helps to reduce bloating and gas. For someone who has had issues with bloating after meals, this drink has been a lifesaver. It has calmed my stomach and helped promote regular, healthy digestion. Lemon‚Äôs Digestive Boost Lemon also plays a significant role in digestion. Its acidic nature helps stimulate the production of bile, which aids in breaking down fats and improving overall digestion. After incorporating lemon into my morning routine, I noticed that I no longer felt weighed down after meals. Instead, I felt light and energized, which made a big difference in my overall health and weight management journey. I even started noticing subtle changes in how my clothes fit, especially around my waistline, which I hadn‚Äôt expected. This drink wasn‚Äôt just keeping my digestion on track; it was also giving my metabolism a gentle boost every morning. By drinking this concoction on an empty stomach, I set the stage for my digestive system to function optimally for the rest of the day. It‚Äôs not about chasing weight loss fads‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating a healthy, sustainable routine that supports your body in the long run. If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned from my experience as a health expert, it‚Äôs that energy and mood are deeply connected to your morning routine. Starting my day with turmeric and lemon water has not only boosted my energy but has also improved my mood in ways I didn‚Äôt anticipate. This simple drink gives me a mental clarity and physical vitality that sets a positive tone for the rest of my day. Turmeric‚Äôs Role in Mental Clarity Curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, is known to support brain health by increasing levels of a hormone called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is like fertilizer for your brain cells‚Äîit helps them grow, repair, and function optimally. For someone like me, who juggles work, family, and personal time, this has been a game-changer. I feel more focused and less mentally fatigued, even on days when my schedule is packed. I‚Äôve also noticed that my mood is more stable. There used to be days when I‚Äôd wake up feeling irritable or low for no particular reason. But after incorporating turmeric into my routine, I feel more balanced and resilient. It‚Äôs as if the drink helps clear the mental ‚Äúfog‚Äù and gives me a fresh start each morning. Lemon‚Äôs Energy Boost Lemon, on the other hand, provides a natural and gentle energy lift. Its high vitamin C content helps combat oxidative stress, leaving me feeling rejuvenated. Unlike caffeine, which can cause jitters and crashes, the energy I get from lemon is steady and long-lasting. I also believe that starting the day with a warm, soothing drink has a psychological benefit‚Äîit feels like a small act of self-care that sets a positive tone for the hours ahead. To make it relatable, think about those mornings when you‚Äôre running late, rushing out the door with an empty stomach or just a cup of coffee in hand. Compare that to starting the day with something nourishing and warm, like this drink. The difference is night and day‚Äînot just physically, but emotionally too. One of the most important benefits I‚Äôve experienced from this morning ritual is improved heart health. Cardiovascular health is something we often take for granted until there‚Äôs a problem, but it‚Äôs crucial to take preventive measures. Drinking turmeric and lemon water daily has given me peace of mind, knowing that I‚Äôm actively supporting my heart‚Äôs health. Turmeric for Reducing Inflammation Chronic inflammation is a key factor in heart disease, and turmeric‚Äôs anti-inflammatory properties make it a natural ally for your heart. By reducing inflammation, turmeric helps lower the risk of arterial plaque buildup, which can lead to heart attacks or strokes. I‚Äôve noticed that my cholesterol levels have remained within a healthy range since I started this routine, which is a huge relief given my family‚Äôs history of heart issues. Lemon‚Äôs Role in Heart Health Lemon also contributes to heart health in several ways. It‚Äôs rich in potassium, which helps regulate blood pressure. High blood pressure runs in my family, so this is something I keep a close eye on. By adding lemon to my daily routine, I feel like I‚Äôm taking an active step to maintain healthy blood pressure levels. Additionally, the antioxidants in lemon help reduce oxidative stress, which is another factor in preventing heart disease. What I love most about this ritual is how simple and affordable it is. You don‚Äôt need expensive supplements, fancy gadgets, or complicated routines to reap these benefits. All you need is turmeric, a lemon, and some warm water. It‚Äôs a wellness hack that‚Äôs accessible to almost everyone, regardless of your budget or lifestyle. Easy to Incorporate into Any Routine For me, the simplicity of this practice is what makes it sustainable. Whether I‚Äôm at home, traveling, or dealing with a busy morning, it‚Äôs easy to prepare. I keep a small container of ground turmeric and a few lemons in my kitchen at all times. On particularly hectic days, I‚Äôve even prepared a small thermos of the drink to take with me on the go. There‚Äôs no excuse not to prioritize my health with something this easy and effective. An Investment in Your Health When I think about all the money I‚Äôve spent on skincare products, supplements, and diet programs over the years, it amazes me that such a simple drink has delivered some of the most noticeable results. It‚Äôs a reminder that the best solutions are often the simplest ones. By investing just a few minutes each morning, I‚Äôve made a lasting impact on my overall well-being. For those who are curious, here‚Äôs how I prepare my turmeric and lemon water: 1. Heat about a cup of water until it‚Äôs warm but not boiling. 2. Add a quarter teaspoon of ground turmeric (you can adjust this to your taste). 3. Squeeze the juice of half a lemon into the water. 4. Stir well and drink it slowly, savoring each sip. For an extra boost, I sometimes add a pinch of black pepper, which enhances the absorption of curcumin, or a teaspoon of honey for a touch of sweetness. In my 15 years as a health expert and my personal journey as a woman striving for better health, this morning drink has been one of the most transformative habits I‚Äôve adopted. It‚Äôs more than just a beverage‚Äîit‚Äôs a symbol of self-care, a commitment to my well-being, and a daily reminder that small steps can lead to big results. If you‚Äôre looking for a natural, effective way to boost your health, I encourage you to try this simple ritual. Whether you‚Äôre aiming for better skin, improved digestion, or just a more energized and balanced start to your day, turmeric and lemon water can make a real difference. And who knows? It might just become the highlight of your morning routine, as it has for me. -- -- Health tips, Health remedies to help maximize your everyday life and stay healthy Help Status About Careers Press Blog Privacy Terms Text to speech Teams\n",

      "It‚Äôs a parent‚Äôs nightmare. The worst kind. For a whole ten months, a mother has nurtured her baby in utero. Mother and father spend time bonding with baby, playing soothing music, eating healthy foods, exercising, singing lullabies.

Most women, 98 percent of pregnant women to be exact, give birth in hospitals ‚Äî a place where health professionals are trusted. A place where most often go for life-saving help.

      "In a world bustling with constant noise, endless distractions, and external pressures, it‚Äôs easy to lose sight of who you truly are. We often wear masks to meet societal expectations, bury our emotions to appear strong, and pursue goals that may not resonate with our true selves. This disconnect from our authentic nature can leave us feeling empty, stressed, or unfulfilled. Healing your soul begins with the profound yet liberating journey of self-discovery. It‚Äôs about peeling back the layers, embracing your essence, and understanding the unique being that you are. Your soul is the core of your existence ‚Äì the seat of your emotions, thoughts, and inner peace. When you truly understand yourself, you unlock the ability to heal emotionally, mentally, and even physically. A lack of self-awareness can lead to decisions that are misaligned with your values, relationships that drain your energy, and a life that feels untrue to who you are. The process of understanding who you are is a journey, not a destination. It requires patience, honesty, and vulnerability. Here are some steps to help you along the way: 1.Reflect on Your Past Your experiences shape who you are, but they don‚Äôt define you. Take time to reflect on significant moments in your life ‚Äì the triumphs, the challenges, and even the failures. Ask yourself: What Lessons Have I Learned? How have these experiences influenced my beliefs and behavior? Acknowledging your past, including unresolved pain, can help you release what no longer serves you and make peace with yourself. 2.Identify Your Core Values What truly matters to you? Your values are the compass that guides your decisions and actions. When you live in alignment with them, you feel at peace; when you don‚Äôt, inner conflict arises. Spend time identifying your core values. Are they love, honesty, freedom, creativity, or growth? Use these values to evaluate whether your current life aligns with your authentic self. 3.Practice Self-Awareness Self-awareness is the foundation of self-discovery. It involves observing your thoughts, emotions, and actions without judgment. Journaling can be a powerful tool for this. Write about your feelings, dreams, and fears. Over time, patterns will emerge that offer insight into your true self. Meditation is another effective practice that quiets the mind and allows you to tune into your inner voice. 4.Embrace Your Strengths and Weaknesses Understanding yourself means accepting every part of you ‚Äì the good, the bad, and the messy. Your strengths are gifts, and your weaknesses are opportunities for growth. Don‚Äôt shy away from your imperfections; they make you human. When you stop seeking perfection, you create space for healing and self-love. 5.Let Go of Societal Expectations Many of us carry the weight of societal norms and expectations that dictate how we should live our lives. These external pressures can disconnect you from your true self. Ask yourself: Am I pursuing this career, relationship, or lifestyle for myself or to meet others‚Äô expectations? Letting go of what doesn‚Äôt resonate with you allows you to reclaim your power and live authentically. 6.Connect with Your Inner Child Your inner child is the purest, most authentic version of you. Reconnecting with this part of yourself can help you rediscover forgotten dreams, passions, and joys. What made you happiest as a child? Incorporating these elements into your life can reignite your spirit. As you begin to understand who you are, a sense of inner peace emerges. Here‚Äôs how self-understanding heals your soul: Emotional Healing:Understanding your emotions allows you to process and release them, reducing stress and anxiety. Improved Relationships: When you know and accept yourself, you attract healthier and more fulfilling connections. Enhanced Confidence: Self-awareness helps you trust your decisions and embrace your uniqueness without seeking external validation. The ultimate goal of self-discovery is not to change who you are but to become more of yourself. Embracing your authenticity means celebrating your quirks, following your heart, and standing firm in your truth. It‚Äôs about living with intention and creating a life that reflects your soul‚Äôs desires. Healing your soul by understanding who you are isn‚Äôt always easy, but it‚Äôs one of the most rewarding journeys you‚Äôll ever undertake. Each step brings you closer to a life of freedom, joy, and fulfillment. So, take a deep breath, tune into your inner voice, and start uncovering the beautiful, complex, and resilient person within you. You are worth the journey.

As many people probably know, apart from China, most Western countries don‚Äôt drink hot water. They‚Äôre more accustomed to drinking cold water directly, and there are reasons for this.

      "The ongoing debate surrounding abortion in the United States has been deeply influenced by Donald Trump‚Äôs policies and their lasting impact on reproductive rights. Trump‚Äôs presidency marked a turning point, with his administration prioritizing conservative ideologies that sought to reshape abortion access. As discussions emerge about Trump‚Äôs potential return to office, it‚Äôs important to evaluate how his policies could redefine abortion access in America. During his presidency, Donald Trump‚Äôs administration implemented several measures that significantly restricted abortion access. His reinstatement and expansion of the ‚ÄúMexico City Policy‚Äù ‚Äî commonly known as the Global Gag Rule ‚Äî prohibited U.S. funding for international organizations providing abortion-related services or information. Domestically, his administration rolled back Title X funding for clinics that referred patients for abortions, leaving millions of low-income individuals with limited options for reproductive healthcare. Moreover, Trump appointed three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, cementing a 6‚Äì3 conservative majority.This ideological shift culminated in the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson Women‚Äôs Health Organization decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade.States were given unprecedented authority to restrict or ban abortion, resulting in disparities in abortion access across the nation. Conservative lawmakers and judges played a pivotal role in advancing Trump‚Äôs anti-abortion agenda. State legislatures in Republican-controlled states passed restrictive laws, such as heartbeat bills and near-total abortion bans. Many of these laws relied on the judicial support of Trump-appointed federal judges, who often upheld the legality of these measures. If Trump were to regain office, his influence on federal and state judiciary appointments could further empower lawmakers to pass even stricter regulations. This could potentially lead to the erosion of access to medical abortion, including pills like Misoprostol, which is a widely used and safe method for terminating early pregnancies. Healthcare providers and clinics have borne the brunt of restrictive abortion policies. Many facilities offering abortion services have shut down due to legal hurdles, reduced funding, or fear of criminal liability. This trend could escalate under a renewed Trump presidency, leaving women in states with abortion bans no choice but tobuy abortion pills online. The crackdown on abortion access has also placed significant pressure on providers offering medical abortion Misoprostol. These medications are critical for women unable to access in-clinic procedures due to geographic or financial constraints. A potential Trump presidency could result in stricter regulations, making it harder for women to access abortion pills safely and legally. Trump‚Äôs policies have already left a profound mark on abortion access in America. With his potential return to the White House, there are growing concerns about the future of reproductive rights.For many women, unplanned pregnancy will increasingly lead to seeking abortion pills online or exploring alternative methods, emphasizing the urgent need for policy reforms that prioritize healthcare equity. By examining Trump‚Äôs past policies and their implications, it becomes clear that the battle for abortion access is far from over. As the conversation continues, safeguarding reproductive rights remains crucial for women across the nation. -- -- Hello, I'm Nia Kullen from Florida, an MPH graduate working on projects focused on reproductive health, pregnancy, and abortion to drive positive change.

      "How a Single Choice Set Me on a Life-changing Path Six years ago, I stood at the bottom of a staircase in my apartment building, staring at the steps like they were Mount Everest. I was 50 pounds overweight, out of breath from the simplest activities, and always tired. My doctor had warned me earlier that my lifestyle was taking its toll, but I felt overwhelmed by the idea if turning things around and didn‚Äôt even know where to start from. As I held onto the railing that fateful day, a tiny voice popped into my head: Just take a step, so I did. Then I took another. Before I knew it, I‚Äôd climbed all five flights of stairs to my apartment. I was gasping for air by the time I got to the top, but I felt a flicker of pride I hadn‚Äôt felt in years. It was small, but it was real. The First Step is Always the Hardest That one small action planted a seed. The next morning, I decided to take the stairs again, and then again the day after. Within a week, I wasn‚Äôt avoiding the stairs anymore. Within a month, I was walking around my neighborhood every evening, setting small, attainable goals like making it to the next block or the next park bench. As my stamina grew, I started trying out new activities. I signed up for a local beginner‚Äôs yoga class. Initially, I was terrified of being judged.

People said they heard voices at night and saw that lights were flickering in the house when nobody was living there. But Maya didn‚Äôt believe in ghosts The ghost it was just a myth According to her, there was no ghost which could hurt someone; it was just an evil spirit. Only when she realized that she was actually on its porch, her fingertips lightly touched the darkened brass knob.

      "Hello Northeast Siders. Ah, my cherished readers,It seems this scribe of yours has found herself a touch off her usual stride, a lapse for which she begs your most gracious pardon. One must, after all, tend to one‚Äôs own constitution, even whilst striving to remain the steadfast companion to all who find solace in these words. There are moments, are there not, when the day‚Äôs trials weigh heavy, and one feels a pang of homesickness despite being firmly ensconced at home? Quite the paradox, but alas, all too human. And so, I remind you, dear ones, that it is perfectly permissible to be less than perfectly fine. To grumble, to sigh‚Äîso long as it harms no soul‚Äîis entirely within the remit of our shared humanity. Now, a whisper of forewarning: there may be a day, or perhaps two, in the near future where this Lady Purrshire must momentarily step away from her pen. Thus, I offer my regrets in advance and trust you will forgive me this small indulgence. Until then, I remain, as ever, your most devoted correspondent.

      "There was a small shop, called ‚ÄúWhispers of the Past‚Äù in the middle of the densely built business district. Its owner, Mr. Elias, was a wise man, who preferred to demonstrate his vast knowledge rather than speak much. He had his own store, his personal theatre where everything transpired and stories walked off the pages and into reality. There were faint beginnings only,gathered from overheard stories like the one about the young woman named Clara who came to the bookstore one rainy evening, during a storm. She was a writer, a woman that suffered from creative failure a woman prevented her from writing the novel. A warm sweet note of old paper and the rosy warm light of the reading lamps were calming her. My main goal is to set up a statement that will allow the customer to directly ask the person helping them for the type of product they are searching for..
